With the [rule of thirds](https://blog.depositphotos.com/winning-composition-using-the-rule-of-thirds-in-design.html), you have to train yourself to split your camera screen into a grid.

This asymmetric composition in photography works well for any genre including landscapes, still-life photography, and portraits.

In this still-life image, the photographer employed the most common way of using the rule of thirds by placing the main subject in the center. However, you can put it off-center as seen in the picture below. The photographer positioned a tree with a model near the grid intersection at the bottom left angle, drawing the viewer’s attention to them and creating a more interesting composition.
在这张静物照片中，摄影师采用了最常见的三分法，将主要拍摄对象置于中心。但是，你可以像下图所示那样将其置于中心之外。摄影师将一棵树和模特放在左下角的网格交叉点附近，吸引观众的注意力，并创造出更有趣的构图。
