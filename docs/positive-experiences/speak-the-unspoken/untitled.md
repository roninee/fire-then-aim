The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson——只是有趣
You will have a growing appreciation for life’s basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about.
你将会越来越欣赏生活中的基本体验：简单的友谊的乐趣、创造某种东西、帮助有需要的人、阅读一本好书、与你关心的人一起欢笑。

Sounds boring, doesn’t it? That’s because these things are ordinary. But maybe they’re ordinary for a reason: because they are what actually matters.
听起来很无聊，不是吗？那是因为这些事情很普通。但也许它们之所以普通是有原因的：因为它们才是真正重要的东西。

A person who actually has a high self-worth is able to look at the negative parts of his character frankly—“Yes, sometimes I’m irresponsible with money,” “Yes, sometimes I exaggerate my own successes,” “Yes, I rely too much on others to support me and should be more self-reliant”—and then acts to improve upon them. But entitled people, because they are incapable of acknowledging their own problems openly and honestly, are incapable of improving their lives in any lasting or meaningful way. They are left chasing high after high and accumulate greater and greater levels of denial.
一个真正具有高度自我价值感的人能够坦率地看待自己性格中的消极面——“是的，有时我对金钱不负责任”，“是的，有时我夸大自己的成功”，“是的，我太依赖别人来支持我，应该更加自力更生”——然后采取行动来改善它们。但是，有权利的人，因为他们无法公开诚实地承认自己的问题，所以无法以任何持久或有意义的方式改善他们的生活。他们只能一味追求高处，并积累越来越多的否认。

But eventually reality must hit, and the underlying problems will once again make themselves clear. It’s just a question of when, and how painful it will be.
但最终现实还是会降临，潜在的问题将再次浮出水面。这只是一个时间问题，以及会有多痛苦的问题。
