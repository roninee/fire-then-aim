从一个美国人的角度，总结了如何与美国人在职场和生活沟通的经验。其实和美国人沟通最有效的经验还是Amy Cuddy的fake it until you make it嘛

书里挺多干货 最震撼我的一点是称赞技巧 假设这样一个场景 碰到你很欣赏的导演 **菜鸟：You are great filmmaker.** 听者可能心想：你以为你是谁 哪来的自信评判我是个好导演 **高手：I just want to tell you how much pleasure your wonderful films have given me over the years. Thank you. 我听到这句话 除了震撼 还有种如沐春风的感觉**

## [小的tips](https://book.douban.com/review/5326341/)

有两个小tips关于赞美别人的我觉得很好
1.想赞美一个人就通过第三者，也就是这个人的好朋友或比较亲近的人了，这样不会显得是在拍马屁的
2.就是听到好的赞美要传到被赞美者，被赞美的人会很happy的，冲到nice的信鸽而不是gossip girl

## ["You don't need a book to teach you this..."](https://book.douban.com/review/1610055/)

囫囵吞枣地读了一遍，在原来的评分上降了一颗星。发现只需要看看每一章划出的“重点”就够用了，尽管作者还是极力使自己的语言显得很活泼地。。。内容么，其实可以简短概括如下：

与人有效沟通的方式或者说谈话技巧的重点是：
1.要有自信，或者至少显得有自信;
2.要千方百计使自己显得有趣;
3.要勤奋，事先作好准备，平时多留心**收集信息**;
4.谈话过程中要**时刻集中注意力**，防止自己作出不适宜的行为，并**观察对方的反应**;
5.也是最重要的一点，永远从他人的思维角度出发。也就是说，少装B，而多给对方装B的机会.

如果你有耐心看三遍，相信**第一遍**你会觉得这本书简直是一本**葵花宝典**，毕竟这么细致且有针对性地给出了92条窍门(为什么不是100条呢，真不完整-,-)。**第二遍**你就会不无鄙夷地认识到作者这些所谓招式不仅**虚伪**，而且是在让人不舒服地教你如何manipulate。**第三遍**时你就会觉得其实这些对于天生的**交际花来说只是一些本能**，引用一句amazon上的评论，"You don't need a book to teach you all this."

也就是说，*交际花不看这种书也是交际花，而社交白痴看了也多半是白看，因为不是每个人都能够并且愿意时刻在交谈上花费这么多精力的。*打个不太恰当的比方，喜欢玩游戏的人有两种，一种会千方百计地钻研，力争成为专家级选手，而另一种人，只是为了放松，为了enjoy玩的过程，那么他很有可能不会成为No.1，但也不能被强迫变成第一种人，因为那样他就会痛恨玩游戏了。当然，你可以介于两者之间，用第一种人的态度来为自己玩游戏增加一些挑战和乐趣。这或许正是阅读这本书的最佳心态吧。

## [分享对我最有用的6个聊天小技巧](https://book.douban.com/review/14361127/)

我们生活中有一些能力在我看来属于一个人的基础能力或者说底层能力。这些能力是无论你在哪个行业从事什么样的职位，都非常有用。比如说广阔的视野，健康的身体、充沛的精力、说话的能力。 

基于这个想法，我这两周在开车的时候听完了这本书：《How To Talk To Anyone: 92 Little Tracks for Big Success in Relationships》，直译过来就是 92 个谈话小技巧。我在这里给大家分享6个值得学习的小技巧。 

**第一，保持目光接触。**在与他人交谈时，跟对方保持一个目光的接触。这是非常基础的礼仪，它能表达你对对方的尊重，并且对此次谈话十分投入。 

同时这本书也提出一个注意事项：当你跟女生聊天的时候，你可以多注视一会儿对方的眼睛；但是当你跟男性谈话的时候，你可以少注视一会，不然感觉有点奇怪。 

这个我也深有同感，当我跟一个男性聊天，一直看对方眼睛的时候，我会觉得怪怪的。 

**第二，保持微笑。**在作者看来，微笑是你跟对方展现你的性格、传达你的态度，最简单直接有效的方式。所以作者的观点是，你要精心设计你的微笑，要对着镜子去设计和调整微笑，最好设计好几套，在不同场合面对不同的人，给予不同的微笑。 

**第三，在你不熟悉的领域怎么样跟对方去聊天？**有好几个人同时在场，突然间其他人开始聊起你不了解的某一个领域。那这个时候怎么办呢？这本书提出了一个解决办法：不要不懂装懂，准备一些比较好的问题，去询问对方。 

那这些问题怎么准备呢？你可以现场去搜索 ，如果你可以提前准备这些话题的话，你可以问熟悉这个领域的朋友，请教他在这个领域有没有一些比较好的问题。 

当你提问完了这些话题的时候，如果你还需要跟对方聊，你可以聊一下当前在这个领域比较热门的事件和话题。你可以问一下你的这些朋友，是如何看待这些热门的事件和话题的，这样你就可以跟你的朋友聊很久。 

**第四，多准备一些日常用语的同义词**。一些比较少用，但是听起来高级的词汇，会让你听起来比较有学问。比如，夸奖一个女孩子漂亮，你可以说美丽、楚楚动人、沉鱼落雁、优雅、精致、俊俏、秀丽，也可以说端庄、妩媚等等。平时多总结一些这样的同义词，能让自己更好地表达。 

**第五，如何称赞他人？** 

这里又有两点： 

第一点，**在背后去夸奖别人**。当你要夸某一个人的时候，你要在第三个人面前去夸他，第三个人一定会，把你的夸奖在某一天转述给你要夸奖那个人。在这种情况下，你这个夸奖的效果会好多倍！ 

这个我相信大家应该都有所体会，当你听到某一个人在背后夸奖你的时候，你的感觉也会比这个人当面夸奖你要好很多倍！ 

第二点，当你要当面夸奖某一个人，并且想让他印象深刻时，**你可以夸奖某一个特别独特，特别细致的方面。**比如说，“我觉得你笑起来的时候，你的眉毛特别好看”，这就是非常独特的一点。当别人听到这样的夸奖的时候，他一定会印象深刻的。 

不过，如果你打算这么去做的话，有两个注意事项：第一，**要在私底下一对一去夸奖他。**因为有些比较独特的方面会比较私人化，所以像这种事情就不适合在公共场合去表达。第二，不要经常这么去做，否则会显得有些虚伪，有一种故意为之的感觉。 

第六，永远不要只说“谢谢”，*永远在“谢谢”后面带上原因*。 

比如，“谢谢你花宝贵的时间来看这篇文章，希望对你有用！”

## 92 技巧 中英

Have you ever admired those successful people who seem to" have it all"? You see them chatting confidently at business meetings or comfortably at social parties. They're the ones with the best jobs, the nicest spouses, the finest friends, the biggest bank accounts, or the most fashionable zip codes.
你有没有羡慕过那些看似“拥有一切”的成功人士？你会看到他们在商务会议上自信满满地交谈，或在社交聚会上轻松自在。他们拥有最好的工作、最贤惠的配偶、最要好的朋友、最大的银行账户，或者最时尚的邮政编码。

HOW TO INTRIGUE EVERYONE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
如何不言而喻地激起每个人的兴趣
whenever people meet you, they take an instant mental snapshot. That image of you becomes the data they deal with for a very long time.
每当人们遇见你，他们都会立刻在脑海中拍下你的照片。你的形象会成为他们长期处理的数据。

TECHNIQUE #1 THE FLOODING SMILE
技巧#1：灿烂的笑容
Don't flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person's face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them.
问候时，不要立刻展露笑容，仿佛任何进入你视线的人都会受益。相反，你应该注视对方的脸庞片刻，停顿片刻，感受他们的个性。然后，让一个灿烂、温暖、富有回应的笑容洋溢在你的脸上，并溢出你的双眼。它会像一股暖流般将接受者包围。这瞬间的延迟，能让人们相信你那灿烂的笑容是真诚的，而且只为他们而绽放。

TECHNIQUE #2 STICKY EYES 技巧二：眼睛发粘
Pretend your eyes are glued to your conversation partner's with sticky warm taffy. Don't break eye contact even after he or she has finished speaking. When you must look away, do it ever so slowly, reluctantly, stretching the gooey taffy until the tiny string finally breaks. When talking to men, you, too, can use Sticky Eyes. Just make them a little less sticky when discussing personal matters with other men,
假装你的眼睛像黏糊糊的温热太妃糖一样粘在谈话对象身上。即使对方说完了，也不要中断目光接触。当你必须移开视线时，要缓慢地、不情愿地移开，就像把黏糊糊的太妃糖拉长，直到细小的线最终断裂。和男人说话时，你也可以使用“黏糊糊的眼神”。只是在和其他男人谈论私人话题时，不要太黏。

TECHNIQUE #3 EPOXY EYES 技巧3：环氧树脂眼影
This brazen technique packs a powerful punch. Watch your target person even when someone else is talking. No matter who is speaking, keep looking at the man or woman you want to impact. Sometimes using full Epoxy Eyes is too potent, so here is a gentler, yet effective, form. Watch the speaker but let your glance bounce to your target each time the speaker finishes a point. This way Mr. or Ms. Target still feels you are intrigued by his or her reactions, yet there is relief from the intensity. (Never use Epoxy Eyes on strangers in public settings or you could get arrested!)
这种大胆的技巧威力十足。即使别人在说话，也要注视你的目标人物。无论谁在说话，都要一直注视着你想要影响的那个人。有时，用“环氧树脂眼”会显得过于激烈，所以这里有一个更温和但有效的方式。注视着说话者，但每当说话者说完一个观点时，你的目光就会转向你的目标人物。这样，目标人物仍然会感觉到你对他/她的反应很感兴趣，但同时又能减轻你的紧张感。（切勿在公共场合对陌生人使用“环氧树脂眼”，否则你可能会被逮捕！）

TECHNIQUE #4 HANG BY YOUR TEETH
技巧＃4 咬紧牙关
Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from the frame of every door you walk through. Take a bite and, with it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peak of the big top. When you hang by your teeth, every muscle is stretched into perfect posture position.
想象一下，你走过的每一扇门框上都挂着一个马戏团的铁颚。咬一口，用力咬住它，让它带你飞到马戏团的顶峰。当你用牙齿悬挂时，每一块肌肉都被拉伸到完美的姿势。

TECHNIQUE #5 THE BIG-BABY PIVOT
技巧＃5 大宝宝旋转
Give everyone you meet The Big-Baby Pivot. The instant the two of you are introduced, reward your new acquaintance. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the undivided attention you would give a tiny tyke who crawled up to your feet, turned a precious face up to yours, and beamed a big toothless grin. Pivoting 100 percent toward the new person shouts "I think you are very, very special."
给每个你遇到的人一个“大宝贝转身”。当你们俩被介绍给新认识的人时，一定要好好犒劳一下他。给他一个温暖的微笑，一个转身，以及全心全意的关注，就像对待一个爬到你脚边，把可爱的脸转向你，露出灿烂无牙笑容的小家伙一样。将整个身子转向新认识的人，就像在喊：“我觉得你非常非常特别。”

Even if your Hang by Your Teeth posture is gaining their respect, your Flooding Smile and The Big-Baby Pivot are making them feel special, and your Sticky Eyes are capturing their hearts and minds, the rest of your body can reveal any incongruence. Every inch— from the crinkle of your forehead to the position of your feet— must give a command performance if you want to effectively present an "I care about you" attitude.
即使你“咬紧牙关”的姿势赢得了他们的尊重，你“灿烂的笑容”和“大宝贝式转身”让他们感到特别，你“黏糊糊的眼神”俘获了他们的心，你身体的其他部分仍然会暴露出任何不协调之处。如果你想有效地展现出“我在乎你”的态度，你身体的每一寸——从额头的皱纹到脚的位置——都必须展现出令人敬畏的表现。

TECHNIQUE #6 HELLO OLD FRIEND
技巧＃6 你好老朋友
When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an old friend (an old customer, an old beloved, or someone else you had great affection for). How sad, the vicissitudes of life tore you two asunder. But, holy mackerel, now the party (the meeting, the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend! The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toes— and everything between. An added benefit to the Hello Old Friend technique is it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you act as though you like someone, you start to really like them.
遇见某人时，想象他或她是你的一位老朋友（老顾客、老爱人，或者你曾经深爱过的人）。多么令人难过，人生的沧桑将你们分开。但是，我的天哪，现在这场聚会（会议、大会）让你和久违的老朋友重逢了！这种愉悦的体验会在你的身体里引发一系列奇妙的连锁反应，从你下意识地舒展眉毛到脚趾的位置——以及介于两者之间的一切。“你好老朋友”技巧的另一个好处是，它会成为一个自我实现的预言。当你表现出喜欢某人的样子时，你就会开始真正喜欢他们。

You now have all the basics to come across to everyone you meet as a Somebody, a friendly Somebody. But your job isn't over yet. In addition to being liked, you want to appear credible, intelligent, and sure of yourself. Each of the next three techniques accomplishes one of those goals.
现在，你已经掌握了所有基本技能，可以让你在遇到的每个人面前都显得友好亲切。但你的任务还远未结束。除了讨人喜欢之外，你还需要展现出可信、聪明和自信。接下来的三个技巧分别可以实现其中一个目标。

TECHNIQUE #7 LIMIT THE FIDGET
技巧＃7 限制烦躁
Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your puss. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you're fibbing.
当你的谈话真的很重要时，就让你的鼻子发痒、耳朵发麻或脚部刺痛。不要坐立不安、抽搐、扭动、蠕动或抓挠。最重要的是，不要用爪子触碰你的猫。靠近脸部的手部动作以及任何坐立不安的动作都会让听众直觉你在撒谎。

TECHNIQUE #8 HANS'S HORSE SENSE
技巧＃8 汉斯的马感
Make it a habit to get on a dual track while talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how your listener is reacting to what you're saying. Then plan your moves accordingly. If a horse can do it, so can a human. People will say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. You've got horse sense.
养成说话时保持双轨制的习惯。表达自己，但要密切关注听众对你所说内容的反应。然后相应地计划你的行动。如果马能做到，人也能做到。人们会说你对一切都了如指掌。你从不错过任何细节。你拥有马的感知力。

TECHNIQUE #9 WATCH THE SCENE BEFORE YOU MAKE THE SCENE
技巧＃9 先观察场景，再进行拍摄
Rehearse being the Super Somebody you want to be ahead of time. SEE yourself walking around with Hang by Your Teeth posture, shaking hands, smiling the Flooding Smile, and making Sticky Eyes. HEAR yourself chatting comfortably with everyone. FEEL the pleasure of knowing you are in peak form and everyone is gravitating toward you. VISUALIZE yourself a Super Somebody. Then it all happens automatically.
提前练习如何成为你想成为的超级人物。想象自己以“咬紧牙关”的姿势四处走动，与人握手，露出灿烂的笑容，并做着“眼珠子转”的动作。听听自己与每个人轻松愉快地交谈。感受自己处于巅峰状态，每个人都被你吸引的喜悦。想象自己就是一个超级人物。然后，一切都会自然而然地发生。

We now move from the silent world to the spoken word.
我们现在从无声的世界转向有声的世界。

HOW TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY AFTER YOU SAY "HI"
如何知道说完“嗨”之后该说什么

TECHNIQUE #10 MAKE A MOOD MATCH
技巧 #10 打造和谐的氛围
Before opening your mouth, take a "voice sample" of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take a "psychic photograph" of the expression to see if your listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment.
开口之前，先对听众进行“声音采样”，以了解他们的心理状态。拍一张表情的“心灵照片”，看看听众看起来是兴高采烈、无聊透顶还是心烦意乱。如果你想让别人理解你的想法，你必须匹配他们的情绪和语调，哪怕只是片刻。

TECHNIQUE #11 PROSAIC WITH PASSION
技巧#11 平淡中充满激情
Worried about your first words? Fear not, because 80 percent of your listener's impression has nothing to do with your words anyway. Almost anything you say at first is fine. No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting.
担心你的第一句话？别担心，因为听众 80% 的印象与你的措辞无关。几乎你一开始说的任何话都可以。无论文字多么平淡无奇，富有同理心的情绪、积极的态度和充满激情的表达方式都能让你听起来激动人心。

Let's take a quick detour on our road to meaningful communicating. I'll give you three quickie techniques to meet people at parties— then nine more to make small talk not so small.
让我们在通往有效沟通的道路上稍微绕个弯。我会教你三个在聚会上快速结识新朋友的技巧——然后再教你九个让闲聊变得不那么无意义的技巧。

TECHNIQUE #12 ALWAYS WEAR A WHATZIT
技巧 #12 总是戴着 WHATZIT
Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. "Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice your . . . what IS that?"
无论何时参加聚会，都要穿或带一些特别的东西，这样那些在拥挤的房间里觉得你是个令人愉快的陌生人的人就有借口靠近你。“不好意思，我注意到你的……那是什么？”

TECHNIQUE #13 WHOOZAT 技巧 #13 WHOOZAT
Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by non-politicians) meeting-people device ever contrived. Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers.
Whoozat 是迄今为止最有效、使用最少（非政客使用）的见面技巧。只需请派对组织者介绍一下，或者问几个能立即破冰的事实即可。

TECHNIQUE #14 EAVESDROP 技巧14：窃听
IN No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with "Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear. . . ." Will they be taken aback? Momentarily. Will they get over it? Momentarily. Will you be in the conversation? Absolutely!
没有 Wha​​tzit？没有 Whoozat 主持人？没问题！只需悄悄地靠近你想潜入的人群，竖起耳朵。等着任何站不住脚的借口，就插嘴说：“不好意思，我无意中听到了……”他们会吃惊吗？一会儿。他们会释然吗？一会儿。你会加入他们的谈话吗？绝对会！

Let us now hop back on the train that first explored Small Talk City and travel to the land of Meaningful Communicating.
现在让我们重新踏上探索闲聊之城的列车，前往有意义的交流之地。

TECHNIQUE #15 NEVER THE NAKED CITY 生动的答案
技巧#15 绝不是赤裸的城市 兽医的答案
Whenever someone asks you the inevitable, "And where are you from?" never, ever, unfairly challenge their powers of imagination with a one-word answer. Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that conversational partners can comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to your bait, they think you're a great conversationalist. 用生动的情境：比如92年出生，也是Sam Smith出生那年，来替代枯燥的答案；可以抵挡白目的话题：年工资？大概迪拜住一个礼拜都不够吧！
每当有人问你不可避免的问题时，“你来自哪里？”永远、永远不要用一个词的答案来不公平地挑战他们的想象力。了解一些有关您家乡的有趣事实，对话伙伴可以评论这些事实。然后，当他们对你的诱饵说出一些巧妙的话时，他们就会认为你是一个非常健谈的人。 用镰刀的形象：比如92年出生，也是萨姆·史密斯出生那年，来替代枯燥的答案；可以抵挡白目的话题：年工资？大概迪拜住一个礼拜都不够吧！

TECHNIQUE #16 NEVER THE NAKED JOB
技巧 #16 不要做裸体工作
When asked the inevitable "And what do you do," you may think "I'm an economist/ an educator/ an engineer" is giving enough information to engender good conversation. However, to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you might as well be saying "I'm a paleontologist/ psychoanalyst/ pornographer." Flesh it out. Throw out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to munch on. Otherwise, they'll soon excuse themselves, preferring the snacks back at the cheese tray.
当被问到“你是做什么的”这个不可避免的问题时，你可能会觉得“我是经济学家/教育家/工程师”这样的回答已经足够引发良好的对话了。然而，对于既不是经济学家、教育家也不是工程师的人，你不妨说“我是古生物学家/精神分析学家/色情作家”。不妨充实一下。抛出一些关于你工作的趣闻轶事，让新认识的人津津乐道。否则，他们很快就会走开，更喜欢回到奶酪托盘旁吃零食。

TECHNIQUE #17 NEVER THE NAKED INTRODUCTION
技巧#17 不要赤裸裸的介绍
When introducing people, don't throw out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like a big clam, leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic. Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things. Then you're free to stay or float on to the next networking opportunity.
介绍新朋友时，不要扔出没装饵的鱼钩，像个大蛤蜊一样傻笑，让新认识的人自己挥动鱼鳍，寻找话题。用一个有话题的鱼钩来引诱他们。这样你就可以自由地选择留下来，或者继续游向下一个社交机会。

Armed with these two personality enhancers, three conversation igniters, and three small extenders, it is time to take a step up the communications ladder. Let us now rise from small talk and seek the path to more meaningful dialogue. The next technique is guaranteed to make the exchange engrossing for your conversation partner.
掌握了这两个提升个性的技巧、三个开启对话的技巧和三个小小的延伸技巧，是时候在沟通的阶梯上更进一步了。现在，让我们从闲聊中走出来，探索通往更有意义的对话的道路。下一个技巧一定能让你的对话对象全神贯注地参与到交流中。

TECHNIQUE #18 BE A WORD DETECTIVE
技巧#18 成为一名文字侦探
Like a good gumshoe, listen to your conversation partner's every word for clues to his or her preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject that's hot for the other person.
像个好侦探一样，仔细聆听对方说的每一个字，从中寻找线索，了解他或她喜欢的话题。证据必然会不期而至。然后像侦探抓住对方的口误一样，迅速提起这个话题。就像夏洛克·福尔摩斯一样，你掌握了对方热衷话题的线索。

Now that you've ignited stimulating conversation, let's explore a technique to keep it hot.
既然您已经引发了激动人心的对话，那么让我们探索一种让对话保持热度的技巧。

TECHNIQUE #19 THE SWIVELING SPOTLIGHT
技巧＃19 旋转聚光灯
When you meet someone, imagine a giant revolving spotlight between you. When you're talking, the spotlight is on you. When the new person is speaking, it's shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a word about yourself. The longer you keep it shining away from you, the more interesting he or she finds you.
当你遇到某人时，想象一下你们之间有一盏巨大的旋转聚光灯。当你说话时，聚光灯就照在你身上。当陌生人说话时，聚光灯就照在他或她身上。如果你的聚光灯足够亮，陌生人就会忽略你几乎没提过自己。你让聚光灯远离你越久，他或她就越觉得你有趣。

TECHNIQUE #20 PARROTING 技巧 #20 鹦鹉学舌
Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen.
再也不用哑口无言了。像鹦鹉一样，只需重复对话对象说的最后几个词即可。这样，球就回到了他或她的手中，然后你只需要倾听即可。

TECHNIQUE #21 ENCORE! 技巧 #21 再来一次！
The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of the applause is "Encore! Encore! Let's hear it again!" The sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear from your lips when you're talking with a group of people is "Tell them about the time you . . ." Whenever you're at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance. While the two of you are chatting with a group of people, simply turn to him and say, "John, I bet everyone would love to hear about the time you caught that thirty-pound striped bass." Or, "Susan, tell everyone that story you just told me of how you rescued the kitten from the tree." He or she will, of course, demure. Insist!
表演者能听到的掌声中涌出的最甜美的声音是“再来一次！再来一次！让我们再听一遍！” 当你与一群人交谈时，你的谈话对象能从你唇间听到的最甜美的声音是“告诉他们你……” 每当你与重要的人会面或聚会时，想想他或她给你讲过的一些故事。从他们的保留曲目中选择一个合适的、观众会喜欢的故事。然后要求他再次表演，成为焦点。当你们俩正在与一群人交谈时，只需转向他说：“约翰，我敢打赌大家都很想听听你钓到那条三十磅重的条纹鲈鱼的故事。” 或者，“苏珊，把你刚才告诉我的那个从树上救小猫的故事讲给大家听。” 当然，他或她会很拘谨。坚持！

TECHNIQUE #23 THE LATEST NEWS . . . DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT
技巧 #23 最新消息……出门必带
The last move to make before leaving for the party— even after you've given yourself final approval in the mirror— is to turn on the radio news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material. Knowing the big-deal news of the moment is also a defensive move that rescues you from putting your foot in your mouth by asking what everybody's talking about. Foot-in-mouth is not very tasty in public, especially when it's surrounded by egg-on-face.
去参加派对前的最后一步——即使你已经对着镜子对自己的形象表示了最终的认可——是打开广播新闻或浏览一下报纸。今天发生的任何事都是很好的素材。了解当下的重大新闻也是一种防御措施，可以避免你因为询问大家在谈论什么而说错话。在公共场合说错话可不是什么好事，尤其是在周围都是尴尬的时候。

HOW TO TALK LIKE A VIP
如何像 VIP 一样说话

TECHNIQUE #24 WHAT DO YOU DO— NOT!
技巧＃24 你应该做什么——不要！
A sure sign you're a Somebody is the conspicuous absence of the question, "What do you do?”. Asking "How do you spend most of your time?" instead of "And what do you do?"
一个明确标志就是你是一位名人，那就是明显没有问“你是做什么的？”。问“你大部分时间是如何度过的？”而不是“你是做什么的？”

TECHNIQUE #25 THE NUTSHELL RÉSUMÉ
技巧 #25 概要
Just as job-seeking top managers roll a different written rèsumè off their printers for each position they're applying for, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before responding to "What do you do?" ask yourself, "What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?"
正如求职的高层管理人员会为申请的每个职位打印出不同的简历一样，也要为每位听众讲述一个关于你职业生涯的真实故事。在回答“你是做什么的？”之前，问问自己：“这个人可能对我的回答有什么兴趣？他会给我介绍生意吗？他会从我这里买东西吗？他会雇佣我吗？他会娶我的妹妹吗？他会成为我的好友吗？”

TECHNIQUE #26 YOUR PERSONAL THESAURUS
技巧＃26 你的个人词典
Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements. Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and you'll be in the verbally elite.
在同义词库里查找一些你每天使用的常用词。然后，就像把脚伸进新鞋里一样，用舌头尝试几个新词，看看它们是否合适。如果你喜欢这些词，就开始永久地替换它们。记住，仅仅五十个词就能让你的词汇量变得丰富、富有创意，而不是平庸、平庸。每天替换一个词，坚持两个月，你就能成为词汇量上的佼佼者。

TECHNIQUE #27 KILL THE QUICK "ME, TOO!"
技巧＃27 扼杀快速“我也是！”
Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident big cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with a stranger. P.S.: Don't wait too long to reveal your shared interest or it will seem like you're being too tricky. ( "My goodness, why didn't you tell me? I must have been boring you." "Oh, not at all," I replied honestly. "I was enjoying hearing about your trip so much, I was afraid you'd stop if I told you." Her big smile and barely audible "Oh gosh" let me know I had won a new friend.)
当你和某人有共同点时，你拖得越久才说出来，对方就会越感动（和印象深刻）。这样你就会像一只自信的大猫，而不是一只渴望与陌生人快速建立联系的孤独小流浪猫。附言：不要等太久才透露你们的共同兴趣，否则会显得你太狡猾了。（“我的天哪，你为什么不告诉我？我肯定让你觉得无聊了。” “哦，一点也不，”我诚实地回答。“我太喜欢听你讲你的旅行了，我还担心如果我告诉你，你会停下来。” 她灿烂的笑容和几乎听不见的“哦，天哪”让我知道我交了一个新朋友。）

TECHNIQUE #28 COMM-YOU-NICATION
技巧＃28 沟通
Big winners (when they wish to control, inspire, be loved by, sell to people, or get them to go to dinner) do the thinking for them. They translate everything into the other person's terms by starting as many sentences as they can with that powerful little three-letter word, you. Start every appropriate sentence with you. It immediately grabs your listener's attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate it into "me" terms. When you sprinkle you as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation, your listeners find it an irresistible spice.
大赢家（当他们想要控制、激励、被爱、向他人推销或邀请他人共进晚餐时）会替他们思考。他们会尽可能多地用那个强有力的三个字母的词“你”开头，把所有事情都翻译成对方能理解的语言。每个合适的句子都以“你”开头。这能立刻抓住听众的注意力。它会得到更积极的回应，因为它触动了听众的自豪感，让他们不必再用“我”来表达。当你在谈话中像盐和胡椒一样慷慨地撒上“你”的成分时，你的听众会觉得这是一种难以抗拒的调味品。
( Instead of saying "Can I take Friday off, Boss?”, say "Boss, can you do without me Friday?; Instead of saying "I like your suit.”, say "You look great in that suit.”; instead of saying "That's a good question.”, say "You've asked a good question.” ; Salespeople, don't just tell your prospects, "It's important that . . . ." Convince them by informing them, "You'll see the importance of. . . ." When negotiating, instead of, "The result will be . . ." let them know, "You'll see the result when you. . . .” )
（不要说“老板，我星期五可以休息吗？”，而要说“老板，星期五没有我你能行吗？”；不要说“我喜欢你的西装。”，而要说“你穿那套西装很好看。”；不要说“这是一个好问题。”，而要说“你问了一个好问题。”；销售人员，不要只告诉你的潜在客户，“重要的是……”，要告诉他们“你会发现……的重要性。”在谈判时，不要说“结果将是……”，而要让他们知道，“当你……”时，你就会看到结果。”）

TECHNIQUE #31 USE JAWSMITH'S JIVE
技巧 #31 使用 JAWSMITH 的 JIVE
Whether you're standing behind a podium facing thousands or behind the barbecue grill facing your family, you'll move, amuse, and motivate with the same skills. Read speakers' books to cull quotations, pull pearls of wisdom, and get gems to tickle their funny bones. Find a few bon mots to let casually slide off your tongue on chosen occasions. If you want to be notable, dream up a crazy quotable. Make 'em rhyme, make 'em clever, or make 'em funny. Above all, make 'em relevant.
无论你是站在讲台后面，面对成千上万的人，还是坐在烧烤架后面，面对家人，你都能用同样的技巧感动、逗乐、激励他人。阅读演讲者的著作，筛选引言，汲取智慧的精华，找到一些妙语来逗乐他们。找一些妙语，在特定的场合随意脱口而出。如果你想引人注目，那就构思一些精彩的引言。让它们押韵、巧妙、幽默。最重要的是，让它们与主题相关。
("My daddy's Mr. Farber. I'm Barry,”; Many speakers use author's and speaker's agent Lilly Walters's face-saver lines from her book, What to Say When You're Dying on the Platform. If you tell a joke and no one laughs, try "That joke was designed to get a silent laugh— and it worked." If the microphone lets out an agonizing howl, look at it and say, "I don't understand. I brushed my teeth this morning." If someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, "Could you save that question until I'm finished— and well on my way home?" All pros think of holes they might fall into and then memorize great escape lines. You can do the same.
（“我爸爸是法伯先生，我是巴里”；许多演讲者会引用作者兼经纪人莉莉·沃尔特斯在其著作《当你在讲台上濒死时该说些什么》中说过的挽回面子的台词。如果你讲了一个笑话，但没人笑，试试“这个笑话的目的是引人无声的笑声——而且它成功了。”如果麦克风发出一声痛苦的嚎叫，看着它说：“我不明白。我今天早上刷过牙了。”如果有人问你一个你不想回答的问题，“你能把这个问题留到我讲完——然后回家的时候再问吗？”所有专业人士都会想到他们可能会掉进去的陷阱，然后记住很好的逃脱台词。你也可以这样做。

TECHNIQUE #33 TRASH THE TEASING
技巧#33 别再戏弄别人
A dead giveaway of a little cat is his or her proclivity to tease. An innocent joke at someone else's expense may get you a cheap laugh. Nevertheless, the big cats will have the last one. Because you'll bang your head against the glass ceiling they construct to keep little cats from stepping on their paws. Never, ever, make a joke at anyone else's expense. You'll wind up paying for it, dearly.
小猫咪最明显的特征就是它爱开玩笑。拿别人开玩笑或许能让你笑得一塌糊涂。然而，最后笑点会落到大猫身上。因为你会撞上它们为了防止小猫咪踩到自己的爪子而建起的玻璃天花板。永远不要拿别人开玩笑。你最终会为此付出惨痛的代价。

TECHNIQUE #34 IT'S THE RECEIVER'S BALL
技术 #34 接球手的球
A football player wouldn't last two beats of the time clock if he made blind passes. A pro throws the ball with the receiver always in mind. Before throwing out any news, keep your receiver in mind. Then deliver it with a smile, a sigh, or a sob. Not according to how you feel about the news, but how the receiver will take it.
如果橄榄球运动员盲传，他连两分钟都坚持不了。职业球员传球时总是会考虑接球者。在传出任何消息之前，先想想你的接球者。然后用微笑、叹息或抽泣来传达信息。不是根据你对消息的感受，而是根据接球者的反应。

TECHNIQUE #36 BIG SHOTS DON'T SLOBBER
技巧 #36 大人物不要流口水
People who are VIPs in their own right don't slobber over celebrities. When you are chatting with one, don't compliment her work, simply say how much pleasure or insight it's given you. (like, "Mr. Allen, I just want to tell you how much pleasure your wonderful films have given me over the years. Thank you so much.”; tell your big boss what an honor it is to work for him. ) If you do single out any one of the star's accomplishments, make sure it's a recent one, not a memory that's getting yellow in her scrapbook. If the queen bee has a drone sitting with her, find a way to involve him in the conversation.
本身就是贵宾的人不会对名人垂涎三尺。与名人聊天时，不要夸赞她的作品，只需说说她的作品给你带来了多少乐趣或感悟。（例如，“艾伦先生，我只想告诉你，这些年来，您精彩的电影给我带来了多少快乐。非常感谢。”；告诉你的老板，能为他工作是我的荣幸。）如果你要特别指出这位明星的某项成就，请确保是近期的，而不是她剪贴簿里已经泛黄的记忆。如果这位“女王蜂”身边坐着一位雄蜂，想办法让他参与到谈话中来。

TECHNIQUE #37 NEVER THE NAKED THANK YOU
技巧 #37 不要赤裸裸地感谢
Never let the phrase "thank you" stand alone. From A to Z, always follow it with for: from "Thank you for asking" to "Thank you for zipping me up."
永远不要单独说“谢谢”。从 A 到 Z，后面都要加上“for”：从“谢谢你关心我”到“谢谢你帮我拉上拉链”。

HOW TO BE AN INSIDER IN ANY CROWD
如何成为人群中的知情人

TECHNIQUE #38 SCRAMBLE THERAPY
技巧 #38 混乱疗法
Once a month, scramble your life. Do something you'd never dream of doing. Participate in a sport, go to an exhibition, hear a lecture on something totally out of your experience. You get 80 percent of the right lingo and insider questions from just one exposure. Think about it! Suppose at a dinner party, the table conversation turns to scuba diving. If you, too, had done your one-time-only dive, you'd ask your diving dinner companion if he likes night diving or whether he prefers diving on wrecks or reefs. (He'll never believe it when you tell him the deepest water you've ever submerged yourself in is your own bathtub.) Then you turn to the bungee jumper seated on your left and ask him, "Do you prefer chest-waist jumps or ankle jumps?" If the conversation then changes to tennis, or martial arts, or chess, or coin collecting, or even bird-watching, you can keep up and keep the conversation going. What a guy! What a gal!
每月一次，让你的生活焕然一新。做一些你做梦也想不到的事情。参加一项运动，参观一个展览，听一场完全超出你经验范围的讲座。你只需一次接触，就能掌握80%的正确术语和内行问题。想想看！假设在一次晚宴上，餐桌上的话题转到了水肺潜水。如果你也完成了那次仅有的一次潜水，你会问你的潜水同伴是否喜欢夜间潜水，或者他是否更喜欢在沉船或珊瑚礁中潜水。（如果你告诉他，你潜入过的最深的水是你自己的浴缸，他绝对不会相信。）然后你转向坐在你左边的蹦极者，问他：“你喜欢胸腰跳还是踝跳？”如果接下来的话题转到网球、武术、象棋、收藏硬币，甚至是观鸟，你都能跟上他们的谈话，继续下去。真是个好人！真是个好姑娘！

TECHNIQUE #39 LEARN A LITTLE JOBBLEDYGOOK
技巧 #39 学习一点 JOBBLEDYGOOK
Big winners speak Jobbledygook as a second language. What is Jobbledygook? It's the language of other professions. Why speak it? It makes you sound like an insider. Simply ask a friend who speaks the lingo of the crowd you'll be with to teach you a few opening questions. The words are few and the rewards are manifold. That's all you need to get started— two good opening art questions and a warning against the most-asked dumb outsider question.
大赢家们把“职业术语”（Jobbledygook）当成第二语言。什么是“职业术语”？它是其他职业的语言。为什么要说它？它能让你听起来像个业内人士。只需请一位懂你同行行话的朋友教你几个开场白问题。用词简洁，回报却丰厚。这就是你开始所需要的一切——两个巧妙的开场白问题，以及一个提醒，提醒你不要问那些最常问的愚蠢的“外行人”问题。

TECHNIQUE #40 BARING THEIR HOT BUTTON
技巧#40 暴露他们的热点
Before jumping blindly into a bevy of bookbinders or a drove of dentists, find out what the hot issues are in their fields. Every industry has burning concerns the outside world knows little about. Ask your informant to bare the industry buzz. Then, to heat the conversation up, push those buttons.
在盲目地与一群装订工或牙医交谈之前，先了解一下他们所在领域的热点问题。每个行业都有一些外界鲜为人知的热点问题。请你的消息来源揭露行业热点。然后，为了激起讨论的热情，就按下这些按钮吧。

TECHNIQUE #41 READ THEIR RAGS
技巧#41 读懂他们的心声
Is your next big client a golfer, runner, swimmer, surfer, or skier? Are you attending a social function filled with accountants or Zen Buddhists— or anything in between? There are untold thousands of monthly magazines serving every imaginable interest. You can dish up more information than you'll ever need to sound like an insider with anyone just by reading the rags that serve their racket.
你的下一个大客户是高尔夫球手、跑步者、游泳者、冲浪者还是滑雪者？你参加的社交活动，会不会是会计师、禅宗佛教徒，或者其他什么类型的人？市面上有数不清的月刊，涵盖了你能想到的所有领域。你只需阅读这些为他们服务的杂志，就能获得比你想象中更丰富的信息，让你在别人面前显得像个内行人。

TECHNIQUE #43 BLUFFING FOR BARGAINS
技巧#43 虚张声势讨价还价
The haggling skills used in ancient Arab markets are alive and well in contemporary America for big-ticket items. Your price is much lower when you know how to deal. Before every big purchase, find several vendors— a few to learn from and one to buy from. Armed with a few words of industryese, you're ready to head for the store where you're going to buy.
古代阿拉伯市场上的讨价还价技巧在当代美国仍然盛行，尤其在购买高价商品时。懂得如何交易，你的价格会低得多。每次大采购之前，先找几个卖家——几个可以学习，一个可以买。掌握一些行业术语后，你就可以去你想买的商店了。

HOW TO SOUND LIKE YOU'RE PEAS IN A POD
如何让自己听起来像个普通人

Along with making more profound rapport with customers, friends, and associates, using the following techniques develops a deeper understanding and empathy with people of all races and backgrounds. It also opens doors that might otherwise be closed to you.
除了与客户、朋友和同事建立更深厚的融洽关系外，运用以下技巧还能加深对不同种族和背景人士的理解和同理心。它还能为你打开原本可能对你关闭的大门。

TECHNIQUE #44 BE A COPYCLASS
技巧 #44 成为抄袭者
Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small movements? Big movements? Fast? Slow? Jerky? Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy?Pretend the person you are talking to is your dance instructor. Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic mover? Watch his or her body, then imitate the style of movement. That makes your conversation partner subliminally real comfy with you.
观察他人。观察他们的动作。小动作？大动作？快？慢？急促？流畅？年老？年轻？优雅？粗俗？假装你正在交谈的人是你的舞蹈老师。他是爵士舞者吗？她是芭蕾舞者吗？观察他或她的身体，然后模仿他们的动作风格。这会让你的谈话对象潜意识里和你相处得非常舒服。

TECHNIQUE #45 ECHOING 技巧 #45 回响
Echoing is a simple linguistic technique that packs a powerful wallop. Listen to the speaker's arbitrary choice of nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives— and echo them back. Hearing their words come out of your mouth creates subliminal rapport. It makes them feel you share their values, their attitudes, their interests, their experiences.
重复是一种简单的语言技巧，却能产生强大的冲击力。聆听说话者随意选择的名词、动词、介词和形容词，并重复它们。听到他们的话从你口中说出，会建立潜意识的融洽感。这让他们觉得你与他们有着共同的价值观、态度、兴趣和经历。

TECHNIQUE #47 EMPLOY EMPATHIZERS
技巧#47 雇用有同理心的人
Don't be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue with phrases like "I see what you mean." Sprinkle it with sentimental sparklers like "That's a lovely thing to say." Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue.（Empathizers are simple, short, supportive statements. Unlike "uh huh," they are complete sentences such as "I can appreciate you decided to do that," or "That really is exciting." Empathizers can be one-sentence positive critiques like "Yes, that was the honorable thing to do," or "It's charming you felt that way.”）
不要做无意识的“ummer”（笑）。用完整的句子表达你的理解。在对话中穿插一些像“我明白你的意思”这样的短语。也可以加入一些感性的点缀，比如“你说得真好”。你的同理心会打动你的听众，并鼓励他们继续说下去。（同理心是简单、简短、支持性的语句。与“嗯哼”不同，它们是完整的句子，例如“我很感激你决定这么做”或“那真是令人兴奋”。同理心也可以是一句积极的批评，例如“是的，那是一件光荣的事情”或“你这么想真好。”）

TECHNIQUE #49 THE PREMATURE WE
技巧 #49 过早的我们
Create the sensation of intimacy with someone even if you've met just moments before. Scramble the signals in their psyche by skipping conversational levels one and two and cutting right to levels three and four. Elicit intimate feelings by using the magic words we, us, and our. （Ask your prospect's feelings on something the way you would query a friend. ( at work. use the pronoun we when discussing anything that might affect the two of you. " Do you think we're going to prosper during his administration?’ At a party, you might say to someone standing behind you at the buffet line, "Hey, this looks great. They really laid out a nice spread for us." Or, "Uh-oh, we're going to get fat if we let ourselves enjoy all of this.”）
即使你们才刚认识，也要营造亲密感。跳过第一层和第二层对话，直接切入第三层和第四层，扰乱对方心理信号。使用“我们”等神奇词语来激发亲密感。（像询问朋友一样询问对方对某事的感受。在工作中，讨论任何可能影响你们俩的事情时，都要使用代词“我们”。例如，“你觉得在他执政期间，我们会兴旺发达吗？”在聚会上，你可能会对站在自助餐桌后排你身后的人说：“嘿，这看起来太棒了。他们为我们准备了丰盛的餐点。”或者，“哎呀，如果我们尽情享用这一切，我们会变胖的。”）

TECHNIQUE #50 INSTANT HISTORY
技巧 #50 即时历史
When you meet a stranger you'd like to make less a stranger, search for some special moment you shared during your first encounter. Then find a few words that reprieve the laugh, the warm smile, the good feelings the two of you felt. Now, just like old friends, you have a history together, an Instant History.
当你遇到一个陌生人，想要化解彼此的陌生感时，不妨回想一下你们初次相遇时的一些特别时刻。然后，找几句话，让那份欢笑、那份温暖的微笑，以及你们两人共同感受的美好感觉得以重现。现在，就像老朋友一样，你们拥有了共同的历史，一段“瞬间历史”。

Chemistry, charisma, and confidence are three characteristics shared by big winners in all walks of life. Part One helped us make a dynamic, confident, and charismatic first impression with body language. In Part Two, we put smooth small-talk lyrics to our body ballet. Then in Part Three, we seized hints from the big boys and big girls so we're contenders for life's big league. Part Four rescued us from being tongue-tied with folks with whom we have very little in common. And in Part Five, we learned techniques to create instant chemistry, instant intimacy, instant rapport.
化学反应、魅力和自信是各行各业大赢家的共同特质。第一部分帮助我们用肢体语言给人留下充满活力、自信和魅力的第一印象。在第二部分中，我们用流畅的闲聊歌词演绎了肢体芭蕾。在第三部分中，我们从大人物身上汲取灵感，从而成为人生巅峰的有力竞争者。第四部分帮助我们避免与那些几乎没有共同点的人结下不和。在第五部分中，我们学习了如何瞬间建立化学反应、瞬间建立亲密关系、瞬间建立融洽关系。

What's left? You guessed it— making people feel really good about themselves. But compliments are a dangerous weapon in today's world. One mishandling and you can butcher the relationship. Let us now explore the power of praise, the folly of flattery, and how you can use these potent tools effectively.
剩下的是什么？你猜对了——让人们自我感觉良好。但在当今世界，赞美是一件危险的武器。一旦处理不当，就可能毁掉一段关系。现在，让我们来探讨一下赞美的力量、奉承的愚蠢之处，以及如何有效地运用这些强大的工具。

HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE THE POWER OF PRAISE FROM THE FOLLY OF FLATTERY
如何区分赞美的力量和奉承的愚蠢

TECHNIQUE #51 GRAPEVINE GLORY
技巧 #51 小道消息
A compliment one hears is never as exciting as the one he overhears. A priceless way to praise is not by telephone, not by telegraph, but by tell-a-friend. This way you escape possible suspicion that you are an apple-polishing, bootlicking, egg-sucking, back-scratching sycophant trying to win brownie points. You also leave recipients with the happy fantasy that you are telling the whole world about their greatness.
听到的赞美永远比不上无意中听到的赞美更令人兴奋。最有价值的赞美方式不是打电话，也不是电报，而是告诉朋友。这样你就不会被怀疑是一个拍马屁、谄媚奉承、拍马屁、拍马屁的谄媚者，只想博取好感。你还能让接受赞美的人美梦成真，以为你正在向全世界宣扬他们的伟大。

TECHNIQUE #52 CARRIER PIGEON KUDOS
技巧 #52 信鸽 KUDOS
People immediately grow a beak and metamorphosize themselves into carrier pigeons when there's bad news. (It's called gossip.) Instead, become a carrier of good news and kudos. Whenever you hear something complimentary about someone, fly to them with the compliment. Your fans may not posthumously stuff you and put you on display in a museum like Stumpy Joe. But everyone loves the carrier pigeon of kind thoughts. Another way to warm hearts and win friends is to become a carrier pigeon of news items that might interest the recipient. Call, mail, or E-mail people with information they might find interesting. Try it. Think of the money you'll save on greeting cards. A relevant clipping is the big winner's way of saying, "I'm thinking of you and your interests.” （"You know, Sam, Carl said the nicest thing about you the other day."）
每当有坏消息传来，人们就会立刻长出喙，把自己变成信鸽。（这叫做八卦。）相反，要成为好消息和赞誉的传递者。每当你听到关于某人的赞美之词时，就飞到他们身边，把赞美传达给他们。你的粉丝们可能不会在你死后把你做成标本，像矮胖乔那样摆进博物馆。但每个人都喜欢善良想法的信鸽。温暖人心、赢得朋友的另一种方法是成为可能让接收者感兴趣的新闻的信鸽。打电话、写信或发电子邮件，告诉人们他们可能感兴趣的信息。试试看。想想你省下的贺卡费。一张相关的剪报是大赢家表达“我想着你和你的兴趣”的方式。（“你知道吗，萨姆，卡尔前几天对你说了最美的话。”）

TECHNIQUE #53 IMPLIED MAGNIFICENCE
技巧 #53 隐含的华丽
Throw a few comments into your conversation that presuppose something positive about the person you're talking with. But be careful. Don't blow it like the well-intentioned maintenance man. Or the southern boy who, at the prom, thought he was flattering his date when he told her, "Gosh, Mary Lou, for a fat gal you dance real good."
在谈话中插入一些评论，假设对方有一些积极的东西。但要小心。不要像那个好心的维修工那样把事情搞砸了。或者像那个在舞会上自以为是在奉承约会对象的南方男孩那样说：“天哪，玛丽·露，虽然你是个胖姑娘，但你的舞跳得真棒。”

TECHNIQUE #54 ACCIDENTAL ADULATION
技巧＃54 意外的奉承
Become an undercover complimenter. Stealthily sneak praise into the parenthetical part of your sentence. Just don't try to quiz anyone later on your main point. The joyful jolt of your accidental adulation strikes them temporarily deaf to anything that follows.（ "Leil, you're much too young to remember this, but when Apollo 11 landed on the moon . . .” Tell your sixty-five-year-old uncle, "Anyone as fit as you would have zipped right up those steps, but boy, was I out of breath." Tell a colleague: "Because you're so knowledgeable in contract law, you would have read between the lines, but stupidly, I signed it.”）
做一个隐秘的赞美者。偷偷地在句子的括号里加上赞美。只是不要事后再盘问别人你的要点。你无意中奉承的喜悦之情会让他们暂时对接下来的任何事情都充耳不闻。（“莉尔，你太年轻了，记不住这些，但是当阿波罗11号登陆月球时……”）告诉你65岁的叔叔：“像你这样身体强健的人都能快速爬上那些台阶，但是我当时上气不接下气。” 告诉同事：“因为你对合同法了如指掌，你一定能读懂字里行间的意思，但我愚蠢地签了字。”）

TECHNIQUE #55 KILLER COMPLIMENT
技巧＃55 杀手级赞美
A Killer Compliment is not "I like your tie" or "You're a very nice person." (The first is not personal enough and the second is not specific enough.) A Killer Compliment is more like "What exquisite eyes you have," (very specific) or "You have a wonderful air of honesty about you," (very personal).
杀手级的赞美不是“我喜欢你的领带”或“你是一个非常好的人在。”（第一点不够个人化，第二点不够具体。）杀手级的赞美更像是“你的眼睛多么精致啊！”（非常具体）或“你身上有一种非常诚实的气质！”（非常个人化）。
Whenever you are talking with a stranger you'd like to make part of your professional or personal future, search for one attractive, specific, and unique quality he or she has. At the end of the conversation, look the individual right in the eye. Say his or her name and proceed to curl all ten toes with the Killer Compliment.
当你和一个陌生人交谈时，如果你希望他/她成为你职业或个人未来的一部分，那就留意他/她身上一个吸引人、独特且有魅力的品质。谈话结束时，直视对方的眼睛。说出他/她的名字，然后用“杀手级赞美”来表达你十个脚趾的敬意。
Rule #1: Deliver your Killer Compliment to the recipient in private. If you are standing with a group of four or five people and you praise one woman for being fit, every other woman feels like a barrel of lard. If you tell one man he has wonderful carriage, every other feels like a hunchback. You also make the blushing recipient uncomfortable.
规则一：私下里向受礼者表达你的杀手级赞美。如果你和四五个人站在一起，夸一位女士身材好，其他女士都会感觉自己像一桶猪油。如果你夸一位男士仪态万方，其他男士都会感觉自己像个驼背。你还会让受礼者脸红心跳，感到不舒服。
Rule #2: Make your Killer Compliment credible. For example, I'm tone-deaf. If I'm forced to sing even a simple song like "Happy Birthday," I sound like a sick pig. If anyone in earshot were foolish enough to tell me they liked my voice, I'd know it was hogwash.
规则二：让你的“杀手级赞美”令人信服。比如，我五音不全。如果我被迫唱一首像《生日快乐》这样简单的歌，我听起来就像一头病猪。如果有人傻到听得懂我说他们喜欢我的声音，我就知道那是胡说八道。
Rule #3: Confer only one Killer Compliment per half year on each recipient. Otherwise you come across as insincere, groveling, obsequious, pandering, and a thoroughly manipulative person. Not cool.
规则三：每半年只对每位受奖人给予一次“杀手级赞美”。否则，你会显得不真诚、卑躬屈膝、谄媚奉承，而且是个彻头彻尾的操纵者。这可不酷。

With careful aim, the Killer Compliment captures everyone. It works best, however, when you use it judiciously on new acquaintances. If you want to praise friends every day, employ the next technique.
只要目标明确，杀手级赞美就能俘获所有人的心。然而，当你明智地将它用在新认识的人身上时，效果最佳。如果你想每天都赞美朋友，不妨试试下一个技巧。

TECHNIQUE #56 LITTLE STROKES
技巧 #56 小笔触
Don't make your colleagues, your friends, your loved ones look at you and silently say, "Haven't I been pretty good today?" Let them know how much you appreciate them by caressing them with verbal Little Strokes like "Nice job!" "Well done!" "Cool!"
不要让你的同事、朋友、爱人看着你，默默地说：“我今天表现得还不错吧？” 用“干得好！”“做得好！”“酷！”之类的言语轻轻抚慰，让他们知道你有多欣赏他们。

TECHNIQUE #57 THE KNEE-JERK "WOW!"
技巧＃57 膝跳反射“哇！”
Quick as a blink, you must praise people the moment they finish a feat. In a wink, like a knee-jerk reaction say, "You were terrific!" Don't worry that they won't believe you. The euphoria of the moment has a strangely numbing effect on the achiever's objective judgment.
别人完成一项壮举时，你必须迅速表扬他们。眨眼之间，就像下意识的反应一样，说：“你太棒了！” 别担心他们不相信你。那一刻的兴奋会对成就者的客观判断产生奇怪的麻木作用。

We've talked a lot about giving compliments, both covert and overt. Now let's talk about a skill that, for many, is even harder— receiving them.
我们已经讨论过很多关于给予赞美的技巧，包括隐蔽的赞美和公开的赞美。现在，我们来谈谈一项对很多人来说更难的技巧——接受赞美。

TECHNIQUE #58 BOOMERANGING
技巧 #58 回旋镖
Just as a boomerang flies right back to the thrower, let compliments boomerang right back to the giver. Like the French, quickly murmur something that expresses "That's very kind of you.” (She says, "I like those shoes." You say, "Oh I'm so happy you told me. I just got them." He says, "You really did a good job on this project." You say, "Oh, that's so nice of you to tell me. I appreciate your positive feedback.” Your colleague asks, "How was your vacation in Hawaii?" You answer, "Oh, you remembered I went to Hawaii! It was great, thanks." Your boss asks, "Are you over your cold now?" You answer, "I appreciate your concern. I feel much better now.” )
就像回旋镖会飞回投掷者手中一样，让赞美也飞回给予者手中。像法国人一样，快速低语几句，表达“您真是太好了”。（她说：“我喜欢这双鞋。”你说：“哦，很高兴你告诉我。我刚拿到。”他说：“你这个项目做得真好。”你说：“哦，你告诉我真是太好了。我很感谢你的积极反馈。”你的同事问：“你在夏威夷的假期怎么样？”你回答：“哦，你还记得我去了夏威夷！太棒了，谢谢。”你的老板问：“你的感冒好了没有？”你回答：“谢谢你的关心。我现在感觉好多了。”）

TECHNIQUE #59 THE TOMBSTONE GAME
技巧 #59 墓碑游戏
Ask the important people in your life what they would like engraved on their tombstone. Chisel it into your memory but don't mention it again. Then, when the moment is right to say "I appreciate you" or "I love you," fill the blanks with the very words they gave you weeks earlier. You take people's breath away when you feed their deepest self-image to them in a compliment. "At last," they say to themselves, "someone who loves me for who I truly am."
问问你生命中重要的人，他们希望在墓碑上刻什么。把它刻在记忆里，但不要再提起。然后，当需要说“我感激你”或“我爱你”的时候，用他们几周前对你说的话来填补空白。当你用一句赞美来表达他们内心深处的自我形象时，你会让他们惊叹不已。“终于，”他们会对自己说，“有人爱我本来的样子了。”

HOW TO DIRECT DIAL THEIR HEARTS
如何打动他们的心

TECHNIQUE #60 TALKING GESTURES
技巧#60 说话的手势
Think of yourself as the star of a personal radio drama every time you pick up the phone. If you want to come across as engaging as you are, you must turn your smiles into sound, your nods into noise, and all your gestures into something your listener can hear. You must replace your gestures with talk. Then punch up the whole act 30 percent!
每次拿起电话，都把自己想象成一部个人广播剧的主角。如果你想展现出如此迷人的魅力，你必须把你的微笑变成声音，把你的点头变成噪音，把你的所有手势变成听众能听到的东西。你必须用言语代替手势。然后，让整个表演的力度提升30%！
To make up for your missing eye contact, punctuate your phone conversations with "Uh huh" or "I hear you." So your listener knows you're nodding in approval, verbalize "I see," "Oh that's great," "No kidding," "Interesting," and "Tell me more!"
为了弥补眼神交流的缺失，在电话交谈中可以用“嗯哼”或“我听见了”来强调。为了让你的听众知道你在点头表示赞同，你可以用“我明白了”、“太好了”、“别开玩笑了”、“有意思”和“再说点别的！”这样的词语来表达。
She didn't see you hitting your head in surprise? Better say "What a surprise!" or "You don't say!"
她没看到你惊讶地撞头吗？最好说“真是意外！”或者“你别说！”
He just said something impressive and he can't see your look of admiration? Try "That was wise of you” or "You're no dummy!"
他刚刚说了句令人印象深刻的话，却没看到你赞赏的表情？试试“你真聪明”或“你真不笨！”
Of course, you need a big verbal smile in your repertoire. Try "Oh, wow, that's funny!" Obviously you're going to choose phrases that match your personality and the situation. Just make sure your phone listeners hear your emotions.
当然，你的口头表达中也需要包含一个大大的微笑。试试“哇，真有趣！”，显然，你会选择符合你个性和当时情况的表达方式。只要确保你的电话听众能听到你的情绪就行。

TECHNIQUE #61 NAME SHOWER
技术 #61 姓名淋浴
People perk up when they hear their own name. Use it more often on the phone than you would in person to keep their attention. Your caller's name re-creates the eye contact, the caress, you might give in person. Saying someone's name repeatedly when face-to-face sounds pandering. But because there is physical distance between you on the phone— sometimes you're a continent apart— you can spray your conversation with it.
人们听到自己的名字就会兴奋起来。在电话里比在面对面时更频繁地使用自己的名字来吸引他们的注意力。对方的名字能让你重现那种眼神交流和爱抚，就像你在面对面时可能会做的那样。面对面时反复提到对方的名字听起来像是在迎合对方。但由于你们在电话里相隔千里——有时你们甚至远隔重洋——你可以用它来丰富你们的谈话内容。

TECHNIQUE #62 "OH WOW, IT'S YOU!"
技巧＃62“哇哦，是你！”
Don't answer the phone with an "I'm just sooo happy all the time" attitude. Answer warmly, crisply, and professionally. Then, after you hear who is calling, let a huge smile of happiness engulf your entire face and spill over into your voice. You make your caller feel as though your giant warm fuzzy smile is reserved for him or her. ("Oh, of course, you're so right," I cooed. "I'm so glad you called.” "Oh my goodness, I'm so glad you told me about that,""Oh, I'm so glad you reminded me of that bill,”)
不要带着“我一直都很开心”的态度接电话。接电话时，要热情、干脆、专业。然后，听清来电者是谁后，让灿烂的笑容充满你的整个脸庞，并流露出你的声音。要让打电话的人觉得，你那温暖而迷人的笑容仿佛是为他或她准备的。（“哦，当然，你说得太对了，”我轻声说道，“很高兴你打电话来。”“哦，天哪，很高兴你告诉我这件事，”“哦，很高兴你提醒了我那张账单，”）

TECHNIQUE #64 SALUTE THE SPOUSE
技巧＃64 向配偶致敬
Whenever you are calling someone's home, always identify and greet the person who answers. Whenever you call someone's office more than once or twice, make friends with the secretary. Anybody who is close enough to answer the phone is close enough to sway the VIP's opinion of you.
无论何时打电话到别人家里，一定要先确认接电话的人是谁，并向他打招呼。无论何时打电话到别人办公室超过一两次，都要和秘书交朋友。任何能接电话的人，只要离得近，就能左右贵宾对你的看法。

TECHNIQUE #65 WHAT COLOR IS YOUR TIME?
技巧#65 你的时间是什么颜色？
No matter how urgent you think your call, always begin by asking the person about timing. Either use the What Color Is Your Time? device or simply ask, "Is this a convenient time for you to talk?" When you ask about timing first, you'll never smash your footprints right in the middle of your telephone partner's sands of time. You'll never get a "No!" just because your timing wasn't right. ("Hi, Joe, is this a good time to talk?" "Hello, Susan. Have you got a minute?" "Hi, Carl, did I catch you good or did I catch you bad?" "Sam, do you have a second for me to tell you about what happened at the game last Saturday?” )
无论你认为你的电话有多紧急，一开始都要先询问对方时间安排。你可以使用“你的时间是什么颜色？”这种技巧，或者直接问：“你现在方便通话吗？” 如果你先询问时间安排，就不会在对方的时间里留下任何痕迹。你永远不会因为时间不对而得到“不！”的答复。（“嗨，乔，现在方便通话吗？” “你好，苏珊，你有时间吗？” “嗨，卡尔，我是不是听错了？” “萨姆，你能给我一点时间让我讲讲上周六比赛的情况吗？”）

TECHNIQUE #67 YOUR TEN-SECOND AUDITION
技巧#67 十秒试镜
While dialing, clear your throat. If an answering machine picks up, pretend the beep is a big Broadway producer saying "Nexxxt." Now you're on. This is Your Ten-Second Audition to prove you are worthy of a quick callback. ("Hi, Harry, this is Andrew. I have the answer to that question you asked me last week." Or "Hi Diane, this is Betsy. I have some big news about that project we were discussing." Now Harry and Diane have a reason to call Andrew and Betsy back.)
拨号时，清清嗓子。如果答录机接通了，就假装嘟嘟声是百老汇大牌制作人说的“Nexxxt”。现在轮到你了。这是你的十秒试听机会，证明你值得快速回电。（“嗨，哈利，我是安德鲁。我知道你上周问我的那个问题的答案。”或者“嗨，黛安，我是贝琪。我有个关于我们之前讨论的那个项目的重大消息。”现在哈利和黛安有理由给安德鲁和贝琪回电话了。）

TECHNIQUE #68 THE HO-HUM CAPER
技巧 #68 无聊的闹剧
Instead of using your party's name, casually let the pronoun he or she roll off your tongue. Forget "Uh, may I speak to Ms. Bigshot please?" Just announce, "Hi, Bob Smith here, is she in?" Tossing the familiar she off your tongue signals to the secretary that you and her boss are old buddies.
不要直接称呼对方的名字，而是随意地使用代词“他/她”。别再说“呃，请问可以和大人物女士通话吗？”，直接说“嗨，我是鲍勃·史密斯，她在吗？” 用熟悉的“她”来称呼秘书，向她表明你和她的老板是老朋友了。

TECHNIQUE #69 "I HEAR YOUR OTHER LINE"
技巧#69 “我听到你的另一句话了”
When you hear a phone in the background, stop speaking— in midsentence, if necessary— and say "I hear your other line," (or your dog barking, your baby crying, your spouse calling you). Ask whether she has to attend to it. Whether she does or not, she'll know you're a top communicator for asking.
当你听到背景中有电话铃声时，请立即停止说话——必要时，最好在话到一半时停止——然后说“我听到了你的另一条线路”（或者你的狗叫声、婴儿的哭声、配偶的呼唤声）。问问她是否需要接电话。无论她是否需要，她都会知道你是一位善于沟通的人，并且会主动询问。

TECHNIQUE #70 INSTANT REPLAY
技巧 #70 即时回放
Record all your business conversations and listen to them again. The second or third time, you pick up on significant subtleties you missed the first time. It's like football fans who often don't know if there was a fumble until they see it all over again in Instant Replay.
把所有商务对话都录下来，再听一遍。第二遍或第三遍，你就能发现第一次错过的重要细节。这就像足球迷经常不知道是否有掉球，直到在即时回放中再次看到。

Let us now return to your live, in-person show. We're going to talk not only about how to be a hit at a party, but how to smoothly hit on all the folks you want— just like a politician.
现在让我们回到你的现场表演。我们不仅要讨论如何在派对上成为焦点，还要讨论如何像政客一样，顺利地搭讪所有你想搭讪的人。

HOW TO WORK A PARTY LIKE A POLITICIAN WORKS A ROOM
如何像政客一样管理一个政党

If corporate cats will be prowling the party, they pack a pocketful of business cards. If it's a gala where people are gadding about on the social ladder and they want to exude old-world elegance, they grab a handful of social cards containing only their name and possibly an address and phone number. (Some feel giving out a business card in a purely social setting can be gauche.) The most vital tool in their party pack is a small pad and pen to keep track of important contacts.
如果公司高层会在派对上出没，他们会带上满满一口袋的名片。如果是社交场合，参加者都是社会名流，而他们又想展现出旧时代的优雅，他们会带上几张社交名片，上面只写着姓名，或许还有地址和电话号码。（有些人觉得在纯粹的社交场合发名片会显得笨拙。）他们派对包里最重要的工具是一本小便笺簿和一支笔，用来记录重要的联系人。

Often people from one profession or one interest group will comprise most of the guest list. A politician never accepts any invitation without asking herself, "What kind of people will be at this party, and what will they be thinking about?" Perhaps there will be a drove of doctors. So she clicks on the latest medical headlines and rehearses a little doc-talk. If the guests are a nest of new-age voters, the politician gets up to speed on telepathic healing, Tantric toning, and trance dancing. Politicians can't afford to not be in the know.
通常，宾客名单上的大部分人都来自同一个行业或同一个利益集团。政客接受任何邀请时，都会先问自己：“什么样的人会来参加这个聚会？他们会想些什么？” 或许会有很多医生。于是，她会点击最新的医学新闻，练习一下医生的谈话。如果宾客是一群新时代选民，政客就会快速介绍心灵感应疗法、密宗调音和恍惚舞。政客们不能不了解情况。

TECHNIQUE #71 MUNCHING OR MINGLING
技巧＃71 咀嚼或交流
Politicians want to be eyeball to eyeball and belly to belly with their constituents. Like any big winner well versed in the science of proxemics and spatial relationships, they know any object except their belt buckle has the effect of a brick wall between two people. Therefore they never hold food or drink at a party. Come to munch or come to mingle. But do not expect to do both. Like a good politician, chow down before you come.
政客们希望与选民面对面、腹对腹。就像任何精通空间关系学的大赢家一样，他们知道除了皮带扣之外的任何物体，都会在两个人之间形成一道墙。因此，他们从不在聚会上拿着食物或饮料。要么来吃点东西，要么来交际。但不要指望两者兼顾。像一个优秀的政客一样，来之前先吃饱。

TECHNIQUE #72 RUBBERNECK THE ROOM
技巧＃72 围观房间
When you arrive at the gathering, stop dramatically in the doorway. Then s-l-o-w-l-y survey the situation. Let your eyes travel back and forth like a SWAT team ready in a heartbeat to wipe out anything that moves.
到达聚会现场后，在门口突然停下脚步。然后慢慢观察周围情况。让你的目光来回扫视，就像一支随时准备消灭任何动静的特警队。

TECHNIQUE #73 BE THE CHOOSER, NOT THE CHOOSEE
技巧＃73 做选择者，而不是被选择者
The lifelong friend, the love of your life, or the business contact who will transform your future may not be at the party. However, someday, somewhere, he or she will be. Make every party a rehearsal for the big event. Do not stand around waiting for the moment when that special person approaches you. You make it happen by exploring every face in the room. No more "ships passing in the night." Capture whatever or whomever you want in your life.
一生挚友、一生挚爱，或是将改变你未来的商业伙伴，或许不会出席这场派对。然而，总有一天，在某个地方，他或她会出现。让每一次派对都成为这场盛事的彩排。不要只是静静地等待那个特别的人靠近你的那一刻。通过观察房间里的每一张脸，你就能抓住它。别再像“夜里擦​​肩而过的船”那样匆匆而过。捕捉生命中你想要的一切或任何人。

TECHNIQUE #74 COME-HITHER HANDS
技巧 #74 吸引手
Be a human magnet, not a human repellent. When standing at a gathering, arrange your body in an open position— especially your arms and hands. People instinctively gravitate toward open palms and wrists seductively arranged in the "come hither" position. They shy away from knuckles in the "get lost or I'll punch you" position. Use your wrists and palms to say "I have nothing to hide," "I accept you and what you're saying," or "I find you sexy."
做吸引人的磁铁，而不是排斥人的家伙。在聚会中站立时，保持身体开放的姿势——尤其是手臂和手掌。人们本能地会被张开的手掌和手腕吸引，它们会做出“过来”的诱惑姿势。他们会避开“滚开，不然我就揍你”的指关节。用你的手腕和手掌来表达“我没什么好隐瞒的”、“我接受你和你所说的话”或者“我觉得你很性感”。

TECHNIQUE #75 TRACKING 技巧 #75 追踪
Like an air-traffic controller, track the tiniest details of your conversation partners' lives. Refer to them in your conversation like a major news story. It creates a powerful sense of intimacy. When you invoke the last major or minor event in anyone's life, it confirms the deep conviction that he or she is an old-style hero around whom the world revolves. And people love you for recognizing their stardom.
像空中交通管制员一样，追踪对话伙伴生活中最细微的细节。在对话中提及他们，就像提及重大新闻一样。这会营造出强烈的亲密感。当你提及某人生命中最近的重大或次要事件时，这更能加深你对他或她的深刻信念：他或她是世界围绕着旋转的经典英雄。人们会因为你认可他们的明星地位而爱你。

TECHNIQUE #76 THE BUSINESS CARD DOSSIER
技巧＃76 名片档案
Right after you've talked to someone at a party, take out your pen. On the back of his or her business card write notes to remind you of the conversation: his favorite restaurant, sport, movie, or drink; whom she admires, where she grew up, a high school honor; or maybe a joke he told. In your next communication, toss off a reference to the favorite restaurant, sport, movie, drink, hometown, high school honor. Or reprieve the laugh over the great joke.
在聚会上和某人聊完之后，立即拿出笔。在他的名片背面写下一些笔记，提醒你这次谈话的内容：他最喜欢的餐厅、运动、电影或饮品；她崇拜的人、她成长的地方、高中荣誉；或者他讲过的一个笑话。下次你们交流时，可以随口提到他最喜欢的餐厅、运动、电影、饮品、家乡或高中荣誉。或者，在那个精彩的笑话之后，让大家开怀大笑。

That's all there is to it. You'll remember to eat before coming to the party (the Munching or Mingling technique) to leave your hands free for heavy networking. When you arrive, you'll stop in the doorway and Rubberneck the Room to get the lay of the land. While rubbernecking, you'll Be the Chooser, Not the Choosee and pick your prospects for the evening. When standing around, you will be relaxing and inviting with Come-Hither Hands.
就是这样。你会记得在参加派对前吃点东西（也就是“吃东西或交际”的技巧），这样就能腾出双手去进行深入的社交。到达后，你会在门口停下来，四处张望，了解一下场地情况。在张望的过程中，你会成为选择者，而不是被选择者，从而挑选出你今晚的约会对象。当你站在那里时，你会放松身心，用“引诱之手”来吸引对方。

You haven't forgotten, of course, to use the meeting-people techniques from previous chapters. If you spot someone you want to talk to, check them out for a Whatzit you can comment on. Finding none, just ask the party giver, Whoozat? If the host or hostess is not in sight, simply stand near your target and resort to the Eavesdrop In technique.
当然，你没有忘记使用前几章学到的与人交往的技巧。如果你发现有人想聊天，就问问他们有什么可以评论的“Whatzit”（什么？）。如果找不到，就问问派对的主人，Whoozat？如果男主人或女主人不在，就站在目标附近，使用“偷听”技巧。

While chatting with anyone you've previously met, you will, of course, use Tracking to win their vote or heart and all the techniques in Part Two to ensure the conversation is interesting for your new acquaintance. Finally, you'll employ Eyeball Selling to make sure you're on target with every conversation. And don't forget, as you say "so long," to scribble material for your next contact on your Business Card Dossier.
与之前认识的人聊天时，你当然会运用“追踪”技巧来赢得他们的支持或好感，并使用第二部分中的所有技巧，确保对话对新认识的人有趣。最后，你会运用“眼球推销”技巧，确保每次对话都切中要点。说“再见”的时候，别忘了在你的名片档案里写下下次联系的资料。

HOW TO BREAK THE MOST TREACHEROUS GLASS CEILING OF ALL
如何打破最危险的玻璃天花板

TECHNIQUE #78 SEE NO BLOOPERS, HEAR NO BLOOPERS
技巧＃78 不要看到任何花絮，不要听到任何花絮
Cool communicators allow their friends, associates, acquaintances, and loved ones the pleasurable myth of being above commonplace bloopers and embarrassing biological functions. They simply don't notice their comrades' minor spills, slips, fumbles, and faux pas. They obviously ignore raspberries and all other signs of human frailty in their fellow mortals. Big winners never gape at another's gaffes.
冷静沟通者会让他们的朋友、同事、熟人和爱人沉浸在超越常见失误和尴尬生理机能的愉悦神话中。他们根本无法察觉同伴的细微失误、失误、笨手笨脚和失态。他们显然会忽略同伴的冷嘲热讽和所有其他人类弱点的迹象。大赢家永远不会对别人的失态感到惊讶。

TECHNIQUE #79 LEND A HELPING TONGUE
技巧＃79 伸出援助之手
Whenever someone's story is aborted, let the interruption play itself out. Give everyone time to dote on the little darling, give their dinner order, or pick up the jagged pieces of china. Then, when the group reassembles, simply say to the person who suffered story-interruptus, "Now please get back to your story." Or better yet, remember where they were and then ask, "So what happened after the . . ." (and fill in the last few words).
每当有人的故事被打断时，就让打断自然发展。给每个人时间去宠爱这个小宝贝，点菜，或者收拾残缺的瓷器碎片。然后，当大家重新集合时，只需对被打断的人说：“现在请继续讲你的故事。” 或者更好的办法是，记住他们刚才讲到哪里了，然后问：“那么之后发生了什么……”（并补充最后几个词）。

LTECHNIQUE #80 BARE THE BURIED WIIFM (AND WIIFY)
技术 #80 揭开埋藏的 WIIFM（和 WIIFY）
Whenever you suggest a meeting or ask a favor, divulge the respective benefits. Reveal what's in it for you and what's in it for the other person— even if it's zip. If any hidden agenda comes up later, you get labeled a sly fox.
无论你提议开会还是请求帮忙，都要说明各自的好处。告诉对方对你和对方有什么好处——即使没有任何好处。如果事后有人透露任何不可告人的计划，你就会被认为是个狡猾的狐狸。

TECHNIQUE #81 LET 'EM SAVOR THE FAVOR
技巧＃81 让他们享受这份恩惠
Whenever a friend agrees to a favor, allow your generous buddy time to relish the joy of his or her beneficence before you make them pay the piper.
每当朋友同意帮忙时，请让你慷慨的朋友有时间享受他或她的善举所带来的快乐，然后再让他们付出代价。

TECHNIQUE #82 TIT FOR (WAIT . . . WAIT) TAT
技巧#82 以牙还牙（等待……等待）
When you do someone a favor and it's obvious that "he owes you one," wait a suitable amount of time before asking him to "pay." Let him enjoy the fact (or fiction) that you did it out of friendship. Don't call in your tit for their tat too swiftly.
当你帮了别人一个忙，而且很明显“他欠你一个人情”的时候，要等一段时间再要求他“还钱”。让他享受你出于友谊而帮他做这件事的事实（或虚构）。不要太快就以牙还牙。

TECHNIQUE #83 PARTIES ARE FOR PRATTER
技巧＃83 聚会是为了闲聊
There are three sacred safe havens in the human jungle where even the toughest tiger knows he must not attack. The first of these is parties. Parties are for pleasantries and good fellowship, not for confrontations. Big players, even when standing next to their enemies at the buffet table, smile and nod. They leave tough talk for tougher settings.
人间丛林中，有三处神圣的避风港，即使是最强悍的猛虎也知道绝不能攻击。其中第一处就是派对。派对是为了寒暄和友谊，而不是为了对抗。大佬们，即使在自助餐桌上与敌人并肩而立，也会微笑点头。他们会把狠话留给更棘手的场合。

TECHNIQUE #84 DINNER'S FOR DINING
技巧#84 晚餐是为了用餐
The most guarded safe haven respected by big winners is the dining table. Breaking bread together is a time when they bring up no unpleasant matters. While eating, they know it's OK to brainstorm and discuss the positive side of the business: their dreams, their desires, their designs. They can free associate and come up with new ideas. But no tough business.
大赢家最看重的安全港湾是餐桌。一起吃饭时，他们不会提起任何不愉快的事情。吃饭时，他们知道可以集思广益，讨论生意的积极方面：他们的梦想、他们的愿望、他们的计划。他们可以自由联想，提出新的想法。但不要谈棘手的事情。

TECHNIQUE #85 CHANCE ENCOUNTERS ARE FOR CHITCHAT
技巧#85 偶遇是为了闲聊
If you're selling, negotiating, or in any sensitive communication with someone, do NOT capitalize on a chance meeting. Keep the melody of your mistaken meeting sweet and light. Otherwise, it could
如果你正在与他人进行销售、谈判或任何敏感沟通，切勿利用偶然的相遇。保持误会的氛围轻松愉快。否则，可能会

TECHNIQUE #86 EMPTY THEIR TANKS
技巧＃86 清空他们的坦克
If you need information, let people have their entire say first. Wait patiently until their needle is on empty and the last drop drips out and splashes on the cement. It's the only way to be sure their tank is empty enough of their own inner noise to start receiving your ideas.
如果你需要信息，先让人们充分表达自己的想法。耐心等待，直到他们的针头空了，最后一滴水滴落到水泥地上。这是确保他们的“水箱”里有足够的空间容纳他们内心的声音，以便开始接受你的想法的唯一方法。

TECHNIQUE #87 ECHO THE EMO Facts speak.
技巧#87 呼应 EMO 事实说话。
Emotions shout. Whenever you need facts from people about an emotional situation, let them emote. Hear their facts but empathize like mad with their emotions. Smearing on the emo is often the only way to calm their emotional storm.
情绪会呐喊。每当你需要从人们那里了解关于情绪状况的事实时，就让他们表达自己的情绪。倾听他们的事实，但要疯狂地体会他们的情绪。抹黑情绪化者往往是平息他们情绪风暴的唯一方法。

TECHNIQUE #88 MY GOOF, YOUR GAIN
技巧 #88 我的失误，你的收获
Whenever you make a boner, make sure your victim benefits. It's not enough to correct your mistake. Ask yourself, "What could I do for this suffering soul so he or she will be delighted I made the flub?" Then do it, fast! In that way, your goof will become your gain.
每当你犯错时，一定要确保受害者受益。仅仅纠正你的错误是不够的。问问自己：“我能为这个受苦的人做些什么，才能让他/她为我的失误感到高兴？” 然后赶紧行动！这样，你的失误就会变成你的收获。

TECHNIQUE #89 LEAVE AN ESCAPE HATCH
技巧#89 留下逃生出口
Whenever you catch someone lying, filching, exaggerating, distorting, or deceiving, don't confront the dirty duck directly. Unless it is your responsibility to catch or correct the culprit— or unless you are saving other innocent victims by doing so— let the transgressor out of your trap with his tricky puss in one piece. Then resolve never to gaze upon it again.
无论何时，当你发现有人撒谎、偷窃、夸大、歪曲或欺骗时，不要直接与那只脏鸭子对峙。除非你有责任抓住或纠正罪犯——或者除非你这样做是为了拯救其他无辜的受害者——否则，最好让罪犯连同他那只狡猾的猫咪一起完好无损地从你的陷阱里出来。然后下定决心，永远不再去看它。

TECHNIQUE #90 BUTTERCUPS FOR THEIR BOSS
技巧＃90 为老板献上花
Do you have a store clerk, accountant, law firm junior partner, tailor, auto mechanic, maître d', massage therapist, kid's teacher— or any other worker you want special attention from in the future? The surefire way to make them care enough to give you their very best is send a buttercup to their boss.
你身边有店员、会计、律师事务所初级合伙人、裁缝、汽车修理工、领班、按摩师、儿童教师——或者其他任何你希望未来得到他们特别关注的员工吗？想要让他们真正关心你、为你倾尽全力，最有效的方法就是送一朵毛茛花给他们的老板。

TECHNIQUE #91 LEAD THE LISTENERS
技巧＃91 引导听众
No matter how prominent the big cat behind the podium is, crouched inside is a little scaredy-cat who is anxious about the crowd's acceptance. Big winners recognize you're a fellow big winner when they see you leading their listeners in a positive reaction. Be the first to applaud or publicly commend the man or woman you agree with (or want favors from).
无论讲台背后的大人物多么引人注目，内心深处都潜伏着一只胆小怕事的小猫，它担心着观众的接受度。当大赢家看到你带领他们的听众做出积极的反应时，他们就会意识到你也是大赢家。要主动为你认同（或希望得到他们支持）的人鼓掌或公开赞扬。

TECHNIQUE #92 THE GREAT SCORECARD IN THE SKY
技巧#92 天空中的大记分卡
Any two people have an invisible scorecard hovering above their heads. The numbers continually fluctuate, but one rule remains: player with lower score pays deference to player with higher score. The penalty for not keeping your eye on The Great Scorecard in the Sky is to be thrown out of the game. Permanently.
任何两个人头顶上都会悬着一张隐形的记分卡。数字不断波动，但有一条规则始终不变：得分较低的玩家要尊重得分较高的玩家。不关注天空中那张“大记分卡”的惩罚是被永久淘汰出局。
