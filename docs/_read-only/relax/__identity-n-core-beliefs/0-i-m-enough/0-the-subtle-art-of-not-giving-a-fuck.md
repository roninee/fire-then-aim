* 作者主要论点是人的精力和时间有限，要只在乎有限的事情（没错，*标题就把整本书概括了*）。

* 作者把*所有人都知道但是非常难做到*的东西写成了一本书

标题太有误导性了*。Not giving a fuck指的是不要像别的美国人一样总要追求“feel-good”心态*。 作者的意思是，不仅要give a fuck，还要figure out which things in your life really matter.

* 其一，追求内心的宁静很难，因为*关心是人的基本存在方式*。
* 其二，*内心宁静是浪漫化的结果，放弃关心意味着放弃许多“不虚此生”的价值。*



###### **CHAPTER第 1 章 ：不要尝试 - 1: Don’t Try**

**C**harles Bukowski**查尔斯·** 布考斯基是个酒鬼、好色之徒、赌徒、流氓、吝啬鬼、懒汉，最糟糕的时候，他还是个诗人。他可能是你最不可能向他寻求人生建议的人，你也最不可能在任何自助书籍中看到他。

布考斯基*想成为一名作家。但几十年来，他的作品几乎被*他投稿的每家杂志、报纸、期刊、经纪人和出版商*都拒绝了*。他们说他的作品很糟糕。粗俗、恶心、堕落。随着拒绝信越积越多，失败的重担使*他陷入了酒精引发的抑郁状态*，这种状态伴随了他一生的大部分时间。

布考斯基白天在邮局当信件投递员。*他薪水很低，大部分都花在了酒上。他把剩下的钱都花在了赛马场上*。晚上，他会独自喝酒，有时还会在他那台破旧的打字机上写诗。他经常会在前一天晚上昏睡过去后醒来。

三十年就这样过去了，大部分时间都是酒精、毒品、赌博和妓女带来的无意义的模糊。后来，当布考斯基五十岁时，在经历了一生的失败和自我厌恶之后，一家小型独立出版社的编辑对他产生了奇怪的兴趣。这位编辑不能给布考斯基很多钱，也不能保证销量。但他对这个醉鬼有一种奇怪的感情，所以他决定给他一个机会。这是布考斯基第一次真正的机会，他意识到，这可能是他一生中唯一一次机会。布考斯基回信给编辑：“*我有两个选择——留在邮局发疯……或者留在这里当作家挨饿。我决定挨饿。”*

Upon signing the contract, Bukowski wrote his first novel in three weeks. It was called simply Post Office. In the dedication, he wrote, *“Dedicated to nobody.”*
签订合同后，布考斯基在三周内写完了第一部小说。小说的名字很简单，叫做 《邮局》。 在题词中，*他写道：“不献给任何人。”*

Bukowski would make it as a novelist and poet. He would go on and publish six novels and hundreds of poems, selling over two million copies of his books. His popularity defied everyone’s expectations, particularly his own.
布考斯基成为了一名小说家和诗人。他出版了六部小说和数百首诗歌，销量超过 200 万册。他的受欢迎程度超出了所有人的预期，尤其是他自己的预期。

Stories like Bukowski’s are the bread and butter of our cultural narrative. Bukowski’s life embodies the American Dream: a man fights for what he wants, never gives up, and eventually achieves his wildest dreams. It’s practically a movie waiting to happen. We all look at stories like Bukowski’s and say, “See? He never gave up. He never stopped trying. He always believed in himself. He persisted against all the odds and made something of himself!”
像布考斯基这样的故事是我们文化叙事的基石。*布考斯基的人生体现了美国梦*：一个人为自己想要的东西而奋斗，永不放弃，最终实现了他最疯狂的梦想。这几乎是一部等待上演的电影。我们都会看着像布考斯基这样的故事说：“看到了吗？他从不放弃。他从未停止尝试。他总是相信自己。他克服了一切困难，*坚持不懈，取得了成就！*”

It is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: *“Don’t try.”*
*奇怪的是，布考斯基的墓碑上刻着这样的墓志铭：“不要尝试。”*

See, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew it. And his success stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but from the fact that he *knew* he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote honestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in Bukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was his simple ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself—especially the worst parts of himself—and to share his failings without hesitation or doubt.
瞧，尽管书卖得很好，名声显赫，但布考斯基是个失败者。他知道这一点。*他的成功并非源于成为胜利者的决心，而是源于他知道自己是个失败者，接受这个事实，然后诚实地写下来*。他从未试图成为任何不同于他自己的人。布考斯基作品的天才之处*不在于克服难以置信的困难，也不在于将自己发展成耀眼的文坛明星*。恰恰相反。他*只是简单地能够完全、毫不畏惧地诚实地面对自己——尤其是自己最糟糕的部分——并毫不犹豫或怀疑地分享自己的失败*。

This is the real story of Bukowski’s success: his comfort with himself as a failure. Bukowski didn’t give a fuck about success. Even after his fame, he still showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in his audience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep with every woman he could find. Fame and success didn’t make him a better person. Nor was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and successful.
这就是布考斯基成功的*真实故事：他以失败为乐。布考斯基根本不在乎成功。即使成名之后，他仍然在诗歌朗诵会上痛骂听众。他仍然在公众场合暴露自己，试图和他能找到的每个女人上床。名声和成功并没有让他成为一个更好的人。他也不是通过成为一个更好的人而出名和成功的。*

Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.
自我提升和成功往往相伴而生。但这并*不一定意味着它们是同一件事*。

Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the planet one day.
*当今的文化过分关注不切实际的积极期望：更快乐。更健康*。成为最好的人，比其他人更好。变得更聪明、更敏捷、更富有、更性感、更受欢迎、更有效率、更令人羡慕、更受人钦佩。成为完美而令人惊叹，每天早餐前排泄出 12 克拉金块，与准备好自拍的配偶和两个半孩子吻别。然后驾驶直升机前往你非常满意的工作岗位，在那里你每天都在做非常有意义的工作，这些工作可能有一天会拯救地球。

But when you stop and really think about it, conventional life advice—all the positive and happy self-help stuff we hear all the time—is actually fixating on what you *lack*. It lasers in on *what you perceive your personal shortcomings and failures to already be,* and then emphasizes them for you. You learn about the best ways to make money *because* you feel you don’t have enough money already. You stand in front of the mirror and repeat affirmations saying that you’re beautiful *because* you feel as though you’re not beautiful already. You follow dating and relationship advice *because* you feel that you’re unlovable already. You try goofy visualization exercises about being more successful *because* you feel as though you aren’t successful enough already.
但是，当你停下来认真思考时，就会发现传统的人生建议——我们经常听到的那些积极向上、令人快乐的自助建议——其实都是针对你*所缺乏的*东西。它会聚焦于*你认为自己已经存在的缺点和失败，* 然后为你强调它们。你会学习最好的赚钱方式 *，因为*你觉得自己已经没有足够的钱。你站在镜子前不断肯定自己很美 *，因为*你觉得自己已经不够美。你听从约会和恋爱建议 *，因为*你觉得自己已经不值得被爱。你尝试一些关于如何取得更大成功的愚蠢的视觉化练习， *因为*你觉得自己还不够成功。

Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just *is*.
讽刺的是，这种对积极事物的执着——对更好、更优越事物的执着——只会一遍又一遍地提醒我们自己不是什么、我们缺乏什么、我们本应该成为但未能成为的人。毕竟，*没有一个真正快乐的人会觉得有必要站在镜子前背诵自己是快乐的*。她只是*快乐而已* 。

There’s a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the loudest.” A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich. Either you are or you are not. And if you’re dreaming of something all the time, then you’re reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over: that you are *not that.*
德克萨斯州有句谚语：“最小的狗叫得最响。”自信的男人不需要证明自己自信。有钱的女人不需要让任何人相信她很有钱。你要么有钱，要么没钱。*如果你一直梦想着某件事，那么你就是在一遍又一遍地强化同一个潜意识现实：你不是那样的人。*

Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, *be* more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick.
*每个人和他们的电视广告都想让你相信，美好生活的关键是一份更好的工作，一辆更坚固的汽车，一个更漂亮的女朋友*，或者一个带充气游泳池的热水浴缸供孩子们玩耍。这个世界不断地告诉你，通往美好生活的道路是更多、更多、更多——买得更多、拥有更多、赚得更多、做更多、 *成为*更多。你不断地被信息轰炸，让你无时无刻不在关心一切。关心一台新电视。关心比你的同事有一个更好的假期。关心买那个新的草坪装饰。关心拥有合适的自拍杆。

Why? My guess: because giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business.
为什么？我猜：因为多关心点事情对生意有好处。

###### 来自地狱的反馈循环 - The Feedback Loop from Hell

You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why you’re so anxious. Now you’re becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you’re anxious about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where’s the whiskey?
*你会因为面对生活中的某个人而感到焦虑。这种焦虑让你无力，你开始想自己为什么这么焦虑。现在你开始因为焦虑而焦虑。 哦不！双倍焦虑！现在你因为自己的焦虑而焦虑，这又会引起更多的焦虑*。快，威士忌在哪儿？

现在问题来了：当今社会，*通过消费文化和社交媒体的奇迹，已经培养了整整一代人，他们认为拥有这些负面体验——焦虑、恐惧、内疚等——是完全不对的*。我的意思是，*如果你看看你的 Facebook 动态，你会发现每个人都过得很开心*。看，本周有 8 个人结婚了！电视上有个 16 岁的女孩在生日那天收到了一辆法拉利。另一个孩子刚刚赚了 20 亿美元，发明了一款应用程序，可以在你用完厕纸时自动为你提供更多厕纸。

与此同时，你却被困在家里帮猫梳毛。你不禁觉得你的生活比你想象的还要糟糕。

The Feedback Loop from Hell has become a borderline epidemic, making many of us overly stressed, overly neurotic, and overly self-loathing.
“地狱反馈循环”已经成为一种边缘流行病，*使我们中的许多人过度紧张、过度神经质和过度自我厌恶。*

Back in Grandpa’s day, he would feel like shit and think to himself, “Gee whiz, I sure do feel like a cow turd today. But hey, I guess that’s just life. Back to shoveling hay.”
回想爷爷那个年代，他会感觉很糟糕，然后自言自语道：“天哪，我今天感觉自己就像一坨牛粪。但是，嘿，我想这就是生活。回去铲干草吧。”

But now? Now if you feel like shit for even five minutes, you’re bombarded with 350 images of people totally happy and having amazing fucking lives, and it’s impossible to not feel like there’s something wrong with you.
但现在呢？*现在，如果你感觉糟糕透顶，哪怕只有五分钟，你就会被 350 张幸福美满 、生活精彩的人的照片轰炸， 你不可能不觉得自己有什么问题。*

It’s this last part that gets us into trouble. We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty for feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry. We get anxious about feeling anxious. What is wrong with me?
正是这最后一部分给我们带来了麻烦。*我们因为感觉不好而感到难过。我们因为感到内疚而感到内疚。我们因为生气而生气。我们因为感到焦虑而焦虑。 我到底怎么了？*

This is why not giving a fuck is so key. This is why it’s going to save the world. And it’s going to save it by accepting that the world is totally fucked and that’s all right, because it’s always been that way, and always will be.
这就是为什么不在乎是如此关键。这就是为什么它能拯救世界。而*拯救世界的方法就是接受世界已经彻底完蛋了，这没关系，因为它一直都是这样，而且永远都会这样。*

Because there’s an infinite amount of things we can now see or know, there are also an infinite number of ways we can discover that we don’t measure up, that we’re not good enough, that things aren’t as great as they could be. And this rips us apart inside.
*因为我们现在能看到或知道的事情是无限的，所以我们也会发现我们无法达到标准*，我们不够好，事情没有达到应有的水平。这让我们内心崩溃。

Because here’s the thing that’s wrong with all of the “How to Be Happy” shit that’s been shared eight million times on Facebook in the past few years—here’s what nobody realizes about all of this crap:
因为过去几年里，Facebook 上那些“如何才能幸福”的垃圾文章已经被分享了八百万次，而这些文章存在一个问题——没有人意识到：

**The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.
渴望更多积极体验本身就是一种消极体验。而矛盾的是，接受消极体验本身就是一种积极体验。**

This is a total mind-fuck. So I’ll give you a minute to unpretzel your brain and maybe read that again: *Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience.* It’s what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “the backwards law”—the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place. The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless of how much money you actually make. The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. The more you want to be spiritually enlightened, the more self-centered and shallow you become in trying to get there.
这简直是​​脑残。所以我给你一分钟时间理清思绪，也许再读一遍： *想要积极的体验是一种消极的体验；接受消极的体验是一种积极的体验。* 这就是哲学家艾伦·瓦茨曾经提到的“倒退定律”——你**越是追求感觉更好，你就越不满足，因为追求某样东西只会强化你一开始就缺乏它的事实**。你越是渴望变得富有，你就越感到贫穷和不值得，不管你实际上赚了多少钱。你越是渴望变得性感和被渴望，你就会越觉得自己丑陋，不管你的实际外表如何。你越是渴望幸福和被爱，你就会变得越孤独和恐惧，不管你周围的人如何。你越是想得到精神上的启迪，你在努力实现它时就会变得越以自我为中心和肤浅。

As the existential philosopher Albert Camus said (and I’m pretty sure he wasn’t on LSD at the time): “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”
正如存在主义哲学家阿尔伯特·加缪所说（我很确定他当时没有服用 LSD）：“如果你一直寻找幸福的本质，你将永远不会幸福。如果你一直在寻找生命的意义，你将永远不会活下去。”

Or put more simply:
或者更简单地说：

Don’t try.
不要尝试。

###### 不在乎的微妙艺术 - The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck



So what does not giving a fuck mean? Let’s look at three “subtleties” that should help clarify the matter.
那么，什么叫不在乎？让我们来看看**三个有助于澄清事实的“微妙之处”**。*

**Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
微妙之处#1：不在乎并不意味着无动于衷；而是意味着能够适应与众不同。**

Let’s be clear. There’s absolutely nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared. They’re couch potatoes and Internet trolls. In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they give way too many fucks. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their hair, so they never bother washing or combing it. They give a fuck about what everyone thinks of their ideas, so they hide behind sarcasm and self-righteous snark. They’re afraid to let anyone get close to them, so they imagine themselves as some special, unique snowflake who has problems that nobody else would ever understand.
让我们明确一点。冷漠绝对不值得钦佩或自信。冷漠的人是无能和恐惧的。他们是沙发土豆和网络喷子。事实上，冷漠的人经常试图表现出冷漠，因为实际上他们太在乎了。他们在乎别人对他们的头发的看法，所以他们从不费心洗头或梳头。他们在乎别人对他们的想法的看法，所以他们躲在讽刺和自以为是的冷嘲热讽背后。他们害怕让任何人接近他们，所以他们把自己想象成一个特殊的、独一无二的雪花，有别人永远无法理解的问题。

Indifferent people are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices. That’s why they don’t make any meaningful choices. They hide in a gray, emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitying, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life.
冷漠的人害怕这个世界和他们自己选择的后果。这就是为什么他们不会做出任何有意义的选择。他们躲在自己制造的灰色、无情的深渊里，自我陶醉、自怜自艾，不断地分散自己对这种需要他们投入时间和精力的不幸事物的注意力，这种不幸的事物就是生命。

Because here’s a sneaky truth about life. There’s no such thing as not giving a fuck. *You must give a fuck about something.* It’s part of our biology to always care about something and therefore to always give a fuck.
因为生活中有一个不为人知的真相。没有不在乎这回事。 *你必须在乎某事。* 我们天生就关心某事，因此也总是在乎。

The question, then, is, *What* do we give a fuck about? What are we *choosing* to give a fuck about? And how can we not give a fuck about what ultimately does not matter?
那么，问题来了，我们到底在乎*什么* ？我们*选择*在乎什么？我们怎么能不在乎那些最终不重要的事情呢？

My mother was recently screwed out of a large chunk of money by a close friend of hers. Had I been indifferent, I would have shrugged my shoulders, sipped my mocha, and downloaded another season of *The Wire.* Sorry, Mom.
我妈妈最近被她的一个好朋友骗走了一大笔钱。如果我当时无动于衷，我会耸耸肩膀，喝着摩卡咖啡，下载另一季 *《火线》。* 对不起，妈妈。

But instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, “No, screw that, Mom. We’re going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole. Why? Because I don’t give a fuck. I will ruin this guy’s life if I have to.”
但相反，我感到愤慨。我生气了。我说：“不，去他的，妈妈。我们要找律师，去追捕这个混蛋。为什么？因为我他妈的不在乎。如果有必要，我会毁掉这个家伙的生活。”

This illustrates the first subtlety of not giving a fuck. When we say, “Damn, watch out, Mark Manson just don’t give a fuck,” we don’t mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about anything; on the contrary, we mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn’t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble. We mean that Mark Manson is the type of guy who would write about himself in third person just because he thought it was the right thing to do. He just doesn’t give a fuck.
这体现了“不在乎”的第一个微妙之处。当我们说“该死，小心，马克·曼森根本不在乎”时，我们的意思并不是说马克·曼森什么都不在乎； 相反，我们的意思是马克·曼森不在乎在实现目标时遇到的逆境，他不在乎激怒某些人去做他认为正确、重要或高尚的事情。我们的意思是马克·曼森是那种会用第三人称写自己，仅仅因为他认为这是正确的事情的人。他根本不在乎。

This is what is so admirable. No, not me, dumbass—the overcoming adversity stuff, the willingness to be different, an outcast, a pariah, all for the sake of one’s own values. The willingness to stare failure in the face and shove your middle finger back at it. The people who don’t give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. The people who just laugh and then do what they believe in anyway. Because they know it’s right. They know it’s more important than they are, more important than their own feelings and their own pride and their own ego. They say, “Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather to everything unimportant in life. They reserve their fucks for what truly matters. Friends. Family. Purpose. Burritos. And an occasional lawsuit or two. And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things that matter, people give a fuck about them in return.
这就是令人钦佩的地方。不，不是我，笨蛋——克服逆境，愿意与众不同，成为一个被排斥的人，一个贱民，这一切都是为了自己的价值观。愿意直面失败，并竖起中指。那些不在乎逆境、失败、让自己难堪或几次尿床的人。那些只是笑一笑然后做自己相信的事情的人。因为他们知道这是对的。他们知道这比他们自己更重要，比他们自己的感受、自己的骄傲和自己的自尊更重要。他们说“去他妈的”，不是对生活中的一切，而是对生活中所有不重要的事情。他们把他们的精力留给真正重要的事情。朋友。家人。目标。墨西哥卷饼。偶尔还有一两起诉讼。正因为如此，因为他们只把精力留给重要的事情，所以人们也会关心他们。

Because here’s another sneaky little truth about life. You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others. You just can’t. Because there’s no such thing as a lack of adversity. It doesn’t exist. The old saying goes that no matter where you go, there you are. Well, the same is true for adversity and failure. No matter where you go, there’s a five-hundred-pound load of shit waiting for you. And that’s perfectly fine. The point isn’t to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with.
因为这是生活中另一个不为人知的小真相。你不可能对某些人产生重要影响，改变他们的生活，但同时又不成为其他人的笑柄和尴尬。你就是做不到。因为没有所谓的没有逆境。它不存在。俗话说，无论你去哪里，你都在那里。好吧，逆境和失败也是如此。无论你去哪里，都有五百磅重的垃圾在等着你。这完全没问题。关键不是要远离这些垃圾。关键是要找到你喜欢处理的垃圾。

**Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
微妙之处#2：要想不在乎逆境，你必须首先在乎比逆境更重要的事情。**

Imagine you’re at a grocery store, and you watch an elderly lady scream at the cashier, berating him for not accepting her thirty-cent coupon. Why does this lady give a fuck? It’s just thirty cents.
想象一下，你在一家杂货店，看到一位老太太对收银员大喊大叫，责骂他不接受她三十美分的优惠券。这位女士为什么在乎？这只是三十美分。

I’ll tell you why: That lady probably doesn’t have anything better to do with her days than to sit at home cutting out coupons. She’s old and lonely. Her kids are dickheads and never visit. She hasn’t had sex in over thirty years. She can’t fart without extreme lower-back pain. Her pension is on its last legs, and she’s probably going to die in a diaper thinking she’s in Candy Land.
我来告诉你原因：那位女士可能除了坐在家里剪优惠券外，没有其他更好的事情可做。她又老又孤独。她的孩子们都是混蛋，从不来看她。她三十多年来都没有过性生活。她放屁都会有严重的腰痛。她的养老金已经所剩无几了，她可能会在尿布里死去，以为自己身处糖果乐园。

So she snips coupons. That’s all she’s got. It’s her and her damn coupons. It’s all she can give a fuck about because there is nothing else to give a fuck about. And so when that pimply-faced seventeen-year-old cashier refuses to accept one of them, when he defends his cash register’s purity the way knights used to defend maidens’ virginity, you can bet Granny is going to erupt. Eighty years of fucks will rain down all at once, like a fiery hailstorm of “Back in my day” and “People used to show more respect” stories.
所以她剪掉了优惠券。这就是她拥有的一切。只有她和她那该死的优惠券。这是她唯一关心的东西，因为没有其他东西可关心。所以当那个满脸痘痘的十七岁收银员拒绝接受其中一张优惠券时，当他像骑士捍卫少女的贞操一样捍卫收银机的纯洁时，你可以打赌奶奶会爆发。八十年的操蛋会一下子倾盆而下，就像一场“回到我的时代”和“人们过去更尊重”故事的烈火冰雹。

The problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they don’t have anything more fuck-worthy to dedicate their fucks to.
那些在夏令营里像分发冰淇淋一样分发性爱的人的问题是，他们没有更值得他们奉献性爱的事情。

If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you—your ex-boyfriend’s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another two-for-one sale on hand sanitizer—chances are you don’t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. And that’s your real problem. Not the hand sanitizer. Not the TV remote.
*如果你发现自己总是对让你烦恼的琐事过于在意——前男友在 Facebook 上发的新照片、电视遥控器电池耗尽的速度、又一次错过洗手液买一送一的促销——那么很可能你生活中没有太多值得你真正在意的事情。这才是你真正的问题。不是洗手液。也不是电视遥控器。*

I once heard an artist say that when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some. I think what most people—especially educated, pampered middle-class white people—consider “life problems” are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about.
我曾听一位艺术家说过，*当一个人没有问题时，他的大脑会自动想办法制造一些问题。我认为大多数人——尤其是受过良好教育、受宠若惊的中产阶级白人——认为的“生活问题”其实只是没有更重要的事情需要担心的副作用。*

It then follows that finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. Because if you don’t find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes.
因此，在你的生活中找到重要而有意义的事情也许是最有效地利用你的时间和精力。因为如果你找不到有意义的事情，你的精力就会被浪费在毫无意义和无聊的事情上。

**Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.
微妙之处#3：无论你是否意识到，你总是在选择自己关心什么。**

People aren’t just born not giving a fuck. In fact, we’re born giving way too many fucks. Ever watch a kid cry his eyes out because his hat is the wrong shade of blue? Exactly. Fuck that kid.
人们并非生来就不在乎。事实上，我们生来就太在乎了。你见过孩子因为帽子的蓝色颜色不对而哭得眼睛都肿起来吗？没错。操那个孩子。

When we’re young, everything is new and exciting, and everything seems to matter so much. Therefore, we give tons of fucks. We give a fuck about everything and everyone—about what people are saying about us, about whether that cute boy/girl called us back or not, about whether our socks match or not, or what color our birthday balloon is.
当我们年轻的时候，一切都是新鲜和令人兴奋的，一切都似乎很重要。因此，我们非常在意。我们在意一切和每个人——在意人们对我们的评价，在意那个可爱的男孩/女孩是否回头，在意我们的袜子是否相配，或者我们的生日气球是什么颜色。

As we get older, with the benefit of experience (and having seen so much time slip by), we begin to notice that most of these sorts of things have little lasting impact on our lives. Those people whose opinions we cared about so much before are no longer present in our lives. Rejections that were painful in the moment have actually worked out for the best. We realize how little attention people pay to the superficial details about us, and we choose not to obsess so much over them.
随着年龄的增长，随着经验的积累（也见证了时间的流逝），我们开始注意到，大多数这类事情对我们的生活几乎没有什么持久的影响。那些我们以前非常在意的人的意见已经不在我们的生活中了。当时痛苦的拒绝实际上带来了最好的结果。我们意识到人们对我们肤浅的细节关注得很少，我们选择不再那么纠结于它们。

Essentially, we become more selective about the fucks we’re willing to give. This is something called maturity. It’s nice; you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy. As Bunk Moreland said to his partner Detective McNulty in *The Wire* (which, fuck you, I still downloaded): “That’s what you get for giving a fuck when it wasn’t your turn to give a fuck.”
从本质上讲，我们变得更加挑剔，更愿意为之付出。这就是所谓的成熟。这很好；你应该尝试一下。成熟就是当一个人学会只在乎真正值得操蛋的事情时。正如邦克·莫兰在 *《火线》* （去你的，我还是下载了）中对他的搭档麦克纳尔蒂侦探说的那样：“这就是你在还没轮到你操蛋的时候在乎的下场。”

Then, as we grow older and enter middle age, something else begins to change. Our energy level drops. Our identity solidifies. We know who we are and we accept ourselves, including some of the parts we aren’t thrilled about.
然后，随着我们年龄的增长，步入中年，其他事情开始发生变化。我们的精力水平下降。我们的身份认同变得牢固。我们知道自己是谁，我们接受自己，包括一些我们不满意的部分。

And, in a strange way, this is liberating. We no longer need to give a fuck about everything. Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that we’re never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Aniston’s tits. And that’s okay. Life goes on. We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks for the most truly fuck-worthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing. And, to our astonishment, *this is enough*. This simplification actually makes us really fucking happy on a consistent basis. And we start to think, Maybe that crazy alcoholic Bukowski was onto something. *Don’t try.*
奇怪的是，这反而是一种解放。我们不再需要关心一切。生活就是生活。我们接受它，包括它的缺点。我们意识到我们永远无法治愈癌症，无法登上月球，也无法抚摸珍妮弗·安妮斯顿的乳房。没关系。生活还要继续。现在，我们把越来越少的性爱留给了我们生活中最值得性爱的部分：我们的家人，我们最好的朋友，我们的高尔夫挥杆。让我们惊讶的是， *这就足够了* 。这种简化实际上让我们一直非常快乐。我们开始想，也许那个疯狂的酒鬼布考斯基发现了什么。 *不要尝试。*

[So Mark, What the Fuck Is the Point of This Book Anyway?
那么马克，这本书到底有什么意义呢？](#calibre_link-273)

This book will help you think a little bit more clearly about what you’re choosing to find important in life and what you’re choosing to find unimportant.
这本书将帮助您更清楚地思考您选择在生活中认为什么重要以及什么不重要。

I believe that today we’re facing a psychological epidemic, one in which people no longer realize it’s okay for things to suck sometimes. I know that sounds intellectually lazy on the surface, but I promise you, it’s a life/death sort of issue.
我认为，我们今天正面临一场心理流行病，人们不再认为有时事情糟糕是可以接受的。我知道这听起来表面上是懒惰的表现，但我向你保证，这是一个生死攸关的问题。

Because when we believe that it’s not okay for things to suck sometimes, then we unconsciously start blaming ourselves. We start to feel as though something is inherently wrong with us, which drives us to all sorts of overcompensation, like buying forty pairs of shoes or downing Xanax with a vodka chaser on a Tuesday night or shooting up a school bus full of kids.
因为当我们认为有时事情很糟糕是不对的，我们就会无意识地开始责怪自己。我们开始觉得我们身上有些东西天生就不对劲，这促使我们做出各种过度补偿，比如买四十双鞋，或者在周二晚上喝伏特加酒，然后服用阿普唑仑，或者向一辆满载孩子的校车开枪。

This belief that it’s not okay to be inadequate sometimes is the source of the growing Feedback Loop from Hell that is coming to dominate our culture.
“有时不够好是不对的”这种信念是日益严重的“地狱反馈循环”的根源，它正在主宰我们的文化。

The idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not. Developing this ability leads to something I like to think of as a kind of “practical enlightenment.”
“不在乎”是一种简单的方式，可以让我们重新调整对生活的期望，选择什么是重要的，什么是不重要的。培养这种能力可以带来一种我喜欢称之为“实践启蒙”的东西。

No, not that airy-fairy, eternal bliss, end-of-all-suffering, bullshitty kind of enlightenment. On the contrary, I see practical enlightenment as becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable—that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and even death. Because once you become comfortable with all the shit that life throws at you (and it will throw a lot of shit, trust me), you become invincible in a sort of low-level spiritual way. After all, the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it.
不，不是那种不切实际、永恒的幸福、结束一切苦难、胡扯的启蒙。相反，我认为实际的启蒙是接受这样一种观点，即某些苦难总是不可避免的——无论你做什么，生活都是由失败、损失、遗憾甚至死亡组成的。因为一旦你接受了生活给你带来的所有麻烦（相信我，它会给你带来很多麻烦），你就会在某种低层次的精神层面上变得无敌。毕竟，克服痛苦的唯一方法是先学会如何忍受它。

This book doesn’t give a fuck about alleviating your problems or your pain. And that is precisely why you will know it’s being honest. This book is not some guide to greatness—it couldn’t be, because greatness is merely an illusion in our minds, a made-up destination that we obligate ourselves to pursue, our own psychological Atlantis.
这本书根本不在乎如何缓解你的问题或痛苦。而这正是你会知道这本书是诚实的。这本书不是通往伟大的指南——它不可能是，因为伟大只是我们头脑中的幻觉，是我们强迫自己去追求的虚构目的地，是我们自己的心理亚特兰蒂斯。

Instead, this book will turn your pain into a tool, your trauma into power, and your problems into slightly better problems. That is real progress. Think of it as a guide to suffering and how to do it better, more meaningfully, with more compassion and more humility. It’s a book about moving lightly despite your heavy burdens, resting easier with your greatest fears, laughing at your tears as you cry them.
相反，这本书会将你的痛苦变成一种工具，将你的创伤变成力量，将你的问题变成稍微好一点的问题。这是真正的进步。把它当作一本关于苦难的指南，教你如何更好地、更有意义地、更富有同情心和更谦逊地应对苦难。这本书教你如何在重担下轻松前行，如何轻松地面对最大的恐惧，如何笑着面对流泪。

This book will not teach you how to gain or achieve, but rather how to lose and let go. It will teach you to take inventory of your life and scrub out all but the most important items. It will teach you to close your eyes and trust that you can fall backwards and still be okay. It will teach you to give fewer fucks. It will teach you to not try.
*这本书不会教你如何获得或实现，而会教你如何失去和放手。*它会教你盘点你的生活，剔除最重要的东西。*它会教你闭上眼睛，相信你可以倒退但仍然没事。它会教你少操心。它会教你不要去尝试。*
