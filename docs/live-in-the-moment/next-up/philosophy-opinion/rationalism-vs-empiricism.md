The main difference between Rationalism And Empiricism is that rationalism is the knowledge that is derived from reason and logic while on the other hand empiricism is the knowledge that is derived from experience and experimentation. Rationalism is about intuition while empiricism is about visual concepts. Mathematics is rationalism while experimental science is empiricism.
理性主义和经验主义之间的主要区别在于，理性主义是源自理性和逻辑的知识，而经验主义是源自经验和实验的知识。理性主义是关于直觉，而经验主义是关于视觉概念。数学是理性主义，而实验科学是经验主义。

### What is Rationalism? 什么是理性主义？

Rationalism is a theory of philosophy in which it is believed that reason and logic are the main sources of knowledge. It is a methodology that says that justification or reason is the view that shows the basis of knowledge. Rationalism goes back in history to 570-495 BCE.
理性主义是一种哲学理论，认为理性和逻辑是知识的主要来源。这是一种方法论，认为论证或理由是显示知识基础的观点。理性主义的历史可以追溯到公元前 570-495 年。

Rationalists believe that logic and reasons can reveal the reality of the world, that some truths exist which can be grasped directly through the intellect. Rationalism can be seen in logical reasoning, mathematics, morals and ethics, and metaphysics. Rationalists highly believe that the reason is fundamentally true and they cannot be denied. They believe that knowledge is independent of sensory experience.
理性主义者相信逻辑和理性可以揭示世界的现实，存在一些可以通过智力直接掌握的真理。理性主义可以在逻辑推理、数学、道德和伦理以及形而上学中看到。理性主义者高度相信理性从根本上来说是正确的，他们不能被否认。他们相信知识独立于感官经验。

There are three basic claims in rationalism. Out of these three claims, rationalists have to adopt at least one. These three thesis are the intuition or deduction thesis, the innate knowledge thesis, and the innate concept thesis. In addition to these, there are two more theories, although a person can be a rationalist without adopting either of them. One is the claim of Indispensability of Reason and the second one is the Superiority of Reason claim.
理性主义有三个基本主张。在这三种主张中，理性主义者必须至少采用一种。这三个命题是直觉或演绎命题、先天知识命题和先天概念命题。除此之外，还有两种理论，尽管一个人不采用其中任何一种也可以成为理性主义者。一是理性的必要性主张，二是理性的优越性主张。

The philosopher and historian William James criticizes the theory of rationalism because it is outdated and does not touch reality. He opposed that the rationalist represents the world as a closed system.
哲学家、历史学家威廉·詹姆斯批评理性主义理论，因为它已经过时且不触及现实。他反对理性主义者将世界描述为一个封闭的系统。

### What is Empiricism? 什么是经验主义？

Empiricism is the term used in philosophy, which states that experimentation and sensory experience is the major source of knowledge. Rather than ideas empiricism emphasized the pieces of evidence. Experiments and evidence show the reality of the world, according to empiricists.
经验主义是哲学中使用的术语，它指出实验和感官经验是知识的主要来源。经验主义强调的是证据，而不是想法。经验主义者认为，实验和证据表明了世界的现实。

Throughout history, the theory of empiricism is described as a blank slate that is filled with experience over time. The human mind is like the blank slate which is empty by birth and is filled in by experience, learning, and experiments. Knowledge is based on the experience we gain, the possibilities and probabilities of our actions, the falsification, the experimental procedure.
纵观历史，经验主义理论被描述为一块白板，随着时间的推移而被经验所填充。人类的心灵就像一块白板，生来就是空的，后来被经验、学习和实验所填充。知识基于我们获得的经验、我们行动的可能性和概率、证伪和实验程序。

The word Empirical is derived from an ancient Greek word “empeiria”, which means experience. The history of the belief in empiricism goes far back to 600 to 200 BCE. An ancient Indian philosopher named Kanada had accepted that the two sources of knowledge are perception and inference. This is mentioned in his work called Vaisesika Sutra, which is an ancient Sanskrit text.
经验一词源自古希腊语“empeiria”，意思是经验。经验主义信仰的历史可以追溯到公元前 600 至 200 年。一位名叫卡纳达的古印度哲学家认为，知识的两个来源是感知和推理。他的著作《吠舍经》中提到了这一点，这是一部古老的梵文文本。

Empiricists believe that experience, and memory develops the person and his morals. They also believe that evidence, any kind of proof which is found by experiment, can reveal the world’s reality, rather than some reason and logic.
经验主义者认为，经验和记忆可以发展人和他的道德。他们还相信，证据，任何通过实验发现的证据，都可以揭示世界的现实，而不是某种理性和逻辑。

### Conclusion 结论

Rationalism and Empiricism are both terms used in philosophy. Both the terms are used under the term epistemology, which is a branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge. Although the terms sound the same, they are too different from each other. Actually, the terms have always been used as opposed to each other. It’s an old controversy. Though both are theories.
理性主义和经验主义都是哲学中使用的术语。这两个术语都在认识论一词下使用，认识论是与知识有关的哲学分支。尽管这些术语听起来相同，但它们彼此之间有很大不同。事实上，这些术语一直以来都是相互对立的。这是一个古老的争议。虽然两者都是理论。

Rationalism regards reasons and logic as the main source of knowledge. They believe in the reasoning behind things and reality. Rationalists believe logic and reason will explain the world’s reality. Rationalists believe that they are independent of sensory experience.
理性主义将理性和逻辑视为知识的主要来源。他们相信事物和现实背后的推理。理性主义者相信逻辑和理性将解释世界的现实。理性主义者相信它们独立于感官体验。
