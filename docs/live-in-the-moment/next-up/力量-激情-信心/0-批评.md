Having not previously heard either of Mr. Kaplan's two recordings of the symphony, nor having seen him conduct, I came to our rehearsals with an open mind. My initial impression was that Mr. Kaplan displays an arrogance and self-delusion that is off-putting. As a conductor, he can best be described as a very poor beater of time who far too often is unable to keep the ensemble together and allows most tempo transitions to fall where they may. His direction lacks few indications of dynamic control or balance and there is absolutely no attempt to give phrases any requisite shape. In rehearsal, he admitted to our orchestra that he is not capable of keeping a steady tempo and that he would have to depend on us for any stability in that department. Considering his Everest-sized ego, this admission must have caused him great consternation upon reflection. Mahler's wonderful use of the off stage brass in the fifth movement gave Kaplan much tribulation. One would think that after more than fifty performances of the work, even the most plebeian of conductors would have some understanding of how to bring together musicians that are separated by great distance. In the performance, these haunting moments of the symphony slipped away like some wayward musical slinky.
我之前没有听过卡普兰先生的两张交响乐录音，也没有看过他的指挥，所以我以开放的心态来参加我们的排练。我最初的印象是卡普兰先生表现出的傲慢和自欺欺人，令人反感。作为一名指挥家，他最适合被描述为一个非常糟糕的节拍者，他经常无法使合奏保持一致，并且允许大多数节奏过渡落在他们可能的地方。他的方向缺乏动态控制或平衡的迹象，并且绝对没有尝试赋予乐句任何必要的形状。在排练中，他向我们的管弦乐队承认，他没有能力保持稳定的节奏，他必须依靠我们来保持该部门的稳定性。考虑到他珠穆朗玛峰般的自负，这一承认一定让他在反思后感到极大的惊愕。马勒在第五乐章中对台下铜管乐器的精彩运用，给卡普兰带来了很大的磨难。人们会认为，在这部作品演出了五十多次之后，即使是最平民化的指挥家也会对如何将相距甚远的音乐家聚集在一起有所了解。在表演中，交响乐中这些令人难忘的时刻就像一些任性的音乐女郎一样消失了。

I have to take extreme exception to the many reviews I have read of his performances. Some critics have written that he brings the finest details of the work to the surface. If his past performances were anything like ours, Mr. Kaplan excels in ignoring the blizzard of Mahler's performance direction.
我必须对我读过的许多关于他的表演的评论抱有极大的异议。一些评论家写道，他将作品中最精彩的细节展现出来。如果卡普兰先生过去的表演与我们的相似，那么他擅长忽视马勒表演方向的暴风雪。

Much has been written about Mr. Kaplan's passion for Mahler's great symphony as if this emotion is unique to him. This assertion is an insult to all professional musicians who have dedicated their entire lives and have sacrificed much toward the preservation of all the great works of history's finest composers. His continued appearances are also an affront to all "real" conductors who have toiled relentlessly for the recognition they duly deserve.
关于卡普兰先生对马勒伟大交响曲的热情已经有很多文章，仿佛这种情感是他独有的。这种说法是对所有职业音乐家的侮辱，他们为保存历史上最优秀作曲家的所有伟大作品奉献了一生并做出了巨大牺牲。他的持续出现也是对所有“真正”指挥家的侮辱，他们为获得应有的认可而不懈努力。
