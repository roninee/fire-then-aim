Odyssey：

文字非常的简单化，删去了很多细节，更通俗易懂。如果英语水平一般的话，可以选择这个译本：但如果想要体会更精粹的史诗文字，建议选择Fagles的译本

举个简单的例子，全书第一行对于Odyssious的描述：

Emily版：complicated man

Fagles版：man of twist and turn

Odyssey，莫里哀(尝试一下没看过的喜剧)，circe

american statand 虽然属于难的，但是朗读的的版本比较喜欢

he top 5 best selling translations

New International Version

King James Version

New Living Translation

New King James Version

English Standard Version

 Americans read versions of the Bible as follows:[12][13]:12–15

King James Version (55%)

New International Version (19%)

New Revised Standard Version (7%)

New American Bible (6%)

The Living Bible (5%)

All other translations (8%)

按文意翻译(Dynamic Equivalent)的译本，包括New International Version (NIV)、很适合个人研读之用的译本。这译本自1987年起便越过KJV成为最畅销之圣经译本。

\2. 采直译方法(Literal)的译本，例如New King James Version (NKJV)。

\3. 用纯粹直译方法(Strictly Literal)的译本，例如New American Standard Bible (NASB)。

 

NIV的英语较为平和浅显，虽不能算精确，对于非母语者可能比较容易些。另外ESV翻译也属于比较准确的，比NIV要好，当然语言也更难一些。

KJV是四百年前写的经典版本，使用古语比如thou，thee，cometh这样的词汇，NKJV修改了这些古语，但保留了其他。

 

你买的那个应该是儿童版。如果从语言的角度来说，NIV(new international version) 是最意译，也是最贴近现代英语的。还有一个NRSV(new revised standard version) 也不错。如果题主想要有挑战性的话，可以用KJV(King James Version)。这个版本使用的是early English。另外有NKJV是此版本的现代英语版。

 

 

NIV使用比例占40%

 

ESV简单易懂但比NIV难a
