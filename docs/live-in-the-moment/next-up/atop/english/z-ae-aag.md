6.抓住一切机会用英语交谈

- 面部表情和手势。所有的交流都有非语言的方面。你可以看到语言的使用者
- 用镜子学习新的语言动作和姿势——这些动作和姿势也当你与人交流时，提供听众的视觉暗示。

- 训练你的肌肉讲话。使用的是正确的姿势。这些姿势对于许多非母语者来说可能很难。训练他们，在前面练习镜子。
- 注意你的声音。声音来源于喉，通常被称为“声音盒”。喉，容纳声带，位于喉部区域。去感受声带振动时，你的手指放在你的喉咙。唱歌或哼唱不同的音调，你会感到喉头振动更高的喉咙中

- 将新的声音逐渐融入你的会话中。融入一个新的声音或语音模式轻松进入您的会话，演讲通常是一个渐进的过程。通过使用新的声音或模式开始在短时间的谈话中（大概五分钟）几次一天越来越长的时，直到你可以毫不费力地使用它。

第一章，阶梯语调

 

 

【base64img：INTONATION  Intonation is simply how we use and change our voice. As we speak, the pitch  tones in our voices change in a way that is similar to when we sing. These  changes are called pitch inflections.  Do you know what I mean? 】

 

 

【base64img：STRESS  In English speech, intonation works together with stress to make certain parts in a  message clearer and more distinct. Stress is given to a word by accentuating certain  syllables. Normally, one syllable is accentuated more strongly than others. This is,  therefore, the syllable with primary stress. Other stressed syllables are given second-  ary stress.  A stressed syllable is spoken longer and louder and with higher pitch. The vowel  within a stressed syllable is pronounced fully. An unstressed syllable, on the other  hand, is spoken shorter and quicker, making the vowel reduced.  VOWEL PRONOUNCED FULLY  VOWEL REDUCED  THE SYLLABLE  PRIMARY STRESS  SECONDARY STRESS  unstressed syllable  length of vowel 】

 

 

【base64img：STEP INFLECTION - Pitch steps down from the stressed syllable onto an  unstressed syllable. Listen to examples spoken with a falling inflection.  simple  amazing  accurate  impossible 】

 

【base64img：GLIDING INFLECTION - Pitch glides on the syllable with primary stress when the word  consists of one syllable, or when that syllable ends a word. Listen to examples with  falling inflection:  now  agreed  Now listen to the same words with a rising inflection.  now  agreed  guaranteed  guaranteed 】

 

【base64img：FALLING AND RISING INFLECTION  Final inflection, which is the pitch change at the end of an utterance, has underlying  meaning. Generally, in connected speech a fall in pitch indicates that the speaker has  finished a thought, while a rise in pitch indicates that the speaker intends to continue  on the thought. Listen to examples:  I know what you mean.  I know what y u mean,  t I don't agree. 】

 

【base64img：Stress for Emphasis and Final Inflection  When primary stress is shifted in a phrase or in a sentence, final inflection also shifts.  Listen to an example with falling inflection.  We are interested.  We are interested.  Now listen to an example with rising inflection:  Are you nt ted?  Repeat examples with falling inflection:  This is correct.  They are special.  0 interested?  This is correct.  They are special. .  We are interested.  A ou interested?  This is correct.  They are special. 】

【base64img：RHYTHM  Rhythlb in speech results from the timing in connected segments. This rhythm  can be compared to the timing in drumbeats. English syllables, for example, are  like long and short beats, with stressed syllables spoken longer and stronger, and  unstressed syllables spoken quicker and lighter.  Function words are normally unstressed and therefore are Often spoken with the  same timing as unstressed syllables. Following are pairs of words and phrases,  for example, that usually sound identical in connected speech. Listen:  announce  offense  an ounce  a fence  arresting  as sorted  are resting  assorted.  In each of the following sets, the items have the same timing. Listen:  today  The day.  available  It's capable.  Repeat the following:  entertain  They're the same.  introduce  What's the use?  organization  Where is the station?  entertaining  Who is waiting?  introducing  We are choosing.  organizational  What did you make of it? 】
