## 副词的功能  

1. 修饰动词，此时副词通常置于动词之后：  

   I work hard
   I love you very much
   He speaks English good (错误：形容词不可用以修饰动词）  
   He speaks English well (正确)

2. 修饰形容词

3. 修饰副词 例如： I work very hard

4. 修饰全句

   1. Evidently, this answer is right

## 状语从句 

一般来讲，英语中的状语从句有九大类，分别可表示时间、地点、原因、目的、结果、条件、让步、比较和方式。  

1. 时间状语从句：when, while, as, before, after, since, till, until, as soon as

   1. when 一般来讲，when的意思相当于at that time（在……时刻），因此
      从句的谓语动词通常是短暂动词，表示某一时刻的动作。不过，when
      引导的从句也可接延续动词（continuous verb）  

      * I started my dinner when he left. 他走了之后，我才开始吃晚饭  
      * He left when I got there. 我到了以后，他才离开  
      * The doorbell rang when I was telephoning  门铃响的时候，我正在打电话。  
      * I was telephoning when the doorbell rang. 我当时正在打电话，突然门铃响了  
      * I was telephoning Harry when she arrived  她到的时候，我正在给哈里打电话。  
      * I telephoned Harry when she arrived.  她到了以后，我给哈里打了一个电话。  
      * I'll speak to him when he arrives. 等他到了我要和他说话。
      * I'll tell him about it when he comes back. 等他回来我要告诉他这件  

   2. while 用作时间连词时，意思相当于during that time（在……期
      间），表示某一时间段内发生的动作。因此，从句的谓语动词通常接
      延续动词。    

      * The phone rang while I was taking my bath  电话铃响的时候我正在洗澡。  此句中while后面的谓语部分taking my bath是一个持续的动作。  
      * The doorbell rang while we were watching TV  此句中while后面的谓语部分watching TV是一个持续的动作。  

   3. until

      1. 延续动词＋until＋短暂动词或时间点  

         * Wait until he comes back.  等他回来吧。  

         * Until I came back, he was waiting for me at my home.  在我回来之前，他一直在我家里等我。  

            这里主句的谓语waiting是延续动词，从句的谓语came是短暂动词。表示wait的动作一直持续到“我回来了”这个时间点为止。  

         * We'll stay here until it stops raining  我们将一直呆到雨停了再走  

         * I will be away from my office until next Tuesday.  我将要离开办公室，要到下周二才能回来。  
            这里的名词短语next Tuesday表示一个时间点，until是一个介词。  

      2. 短暂动词＋until＋短暂动词或时间点  

         * He didn't leave the office until his boss came back  直到老板回来后，他才离开办公室。  
         * I didn't go to bed until 12 o'clock last night.  我昨晚12点才上床睡觉。  

   4. 表示“一……就”的结构  表示这一时间关系的连词有：as soon as，once，the minute，
      the moment，the instant，immediately，directly和instantly等等。  

      * We will leave as soon as it stops raining  雨一停，我们就动身。  
      * It began to rain as soon as I arrived home  
      * The doorbell rang as soon as we began having dinner.  

      可以把上面例句中的连词as soon as 换成其他连词，比如immediately，instantly或directly。请看例句：  

      * It began to rain immediately I arrived home.
      * The doorbell rang immediately we began having dinner.  

2. 地点状语从句  其结构通常就是“where＋陈述句”，从句可以放在句首或句末。 

   * Stay where you are. 呆在原处别动   
   * Generally, air will be heavily polluted where there are factories.
     一般在有工厂的地方，空气污染都会很严重。  
   * A driver should slow down where there are schools. 在有学校的地方，司机应缓行  

3. 原因状语从句  

   * Since we don't have class tomorrow, why not go out for a picnic?
      既然我们明天没有课，那么为什么不出去野餐呢？  
   * As Monday is a national holiday, all government offices will be closed.
      由于周一是法定假日，所有的政府机关都将休息。  
   * It rained last night, for the ground is wet this morning. 昨晚下雨了，因为今天早上地都湿了。
      试 比 较 ： because it rained last night, the ground is wet this morning.
      相比较而言：
      as和for引导的主、从句，二者处于平等位置；
      because引导的从句显得比主句重要，强调原因；  

4. 目的状语从句  引导目的状语从句的连词有：so that, in order that 和 that 。   

   * I turned off the TV in order that my roommate could study in peace and quiet  
      我关掉了电视，好让我的室友安静地学习。  
   * In order that my roommate could study in peace and quiet, I turned off the TV.  
      强调从句  
   * I spoke slowly and clearly so that/in order that the audience could understand me. 
      我讲得既慢又清晰，以便观众能听懂我的话。  

5. 结果状语从句  so...that和such...that。  

   * He is such a good teacher that everyone likes him.  他是一个好老师，所有人都喜欢他  
   * The food in our school canteen is so bad that flies go there to lose weight. 
     我们学校食堂的饭菜质量真差，连苍蝇都飞到那里去减肥  

6. 条件状语从句  最常见的条件状语从句的引导词是if和unless。连词if表示“如果”，unless表示“如果不”或“除非”  

   * If winter comes, can spring be far behind? 冬天来了，春天还会远吗？  

7. 让步状语从句  though, although, even though和even if，  

   1. Although he tried hard, (yet/still) he failed. 尽管他努力了，但他还是失败
      了。  
   2. Although I didn't know anybody at the party, I had a very goodtime. 
   3. 尽管聚会上的人我一个都不认识，但我仍然玩得很愉快  
   4. Though he was inexperienced, he did a very good job.  
      尽管他没有经验，但是他表现得很不错。  

8. 比较状语从句  

   * The work is not as difficult as you think. 这项工作不像你想象的那么难  
   * He is taller than I (am). 他比我高。  

9. 方式状语从句  引导词有：as, like, as if, as though和the way等。
