‘I can't believe you're leaving me on my own!’ cried Hannah. ‘All the family will be in America except me!’

Do you want to see your ticket before I take it down to Marnie?

She watched her brother carry the last case out of the house and give it to the carriage driver. 

Hannah saw the sadness in her mother's eyes.

I'll be back here without a job.

She'll be too busy to think about me.

As she started to drink her chocolate, Hannah thought about Marnie. When Hannah was younger, Marnie had been kind - always smiling and laughing. Then Hannah went away to school, and Marnie changed. She wasn't as friendly anymore. Perhaps on the journey to America,Hannah would ask her why.

This chocolate isn't very nice. It tastes strange she thought,looking into her cup. I'll go and make another cup.

After you put those false accounts in Frost's desk in place of the real accounts for last year, there was nothing he could do. But remember to keep your mouth shut.

What if the police find it?’ said Marnie. Doesn't it show that Mr Frost is innocent??

Their angry faces started to go around and around.

she hoped the family was out.

I expect he's going on business, said Hannah, trying not to sound too interested.

Hannah felt sick as she listened to Daisy. 

Hannah had come to this house to try and get the red book.

It's now or never.

She walked up the servants' stair to the main part of the house, listening carefully.

On a large desk was a red book with gold numbers on the front.

When Hannah got back to Bellevue Road, a man was standing at the front door of her house.

I'm sure my mother paid the rent until the end of this week.

'That's not what it says here’ he said, holding up a black notebook. A new family is moving in tomorrow.

She and Lizzie Bunney had been in the same class at school when they were little. 

I have nothing to say to you or your family.

Hannah remembered that he was away in Liverpool.

The world was against her. 介词 against

Mr Miller has too many important friends. Nobody will believe that I'm innocent.

Although some of the people smelled horrible, Hannah was hungry and she joined them.

I don't know if I believe you, but you look hungry?

The soup didn't taste good, but it was warm.

You need money for that. Or are you getting on the ship without paying?’

But I'll be on that ship.

It was early evening when Hannah went into the Central Library.

At five minutes to seven, a bell rang. The library was closing. She heard one of the assistants walking between the shelves. As the assistant passed by, Hannah quickly moved to the other side of a shelf. When the assistant returned, she moved the other way.

Hannah spent an uncomfortable night on a long wooden seat using her coat as a blanket.

The sound of a key in the main door woke Hannah.

Selling to Daisy had been easy, but she felt nervous about selling in a shop.

I think he was wearing a grey suit, and he was tall. 

It was her only chance to get the red book and she wanted to get to her parents. 

The first class decks were for first class passengers only, but her travelling clothes were the latest fashion, and she looked like a first class passenger.

The passenger list was now on the table. While the telegraph officer was sending the sisters' message, with is back to the table, Hannah quickly looked at the list

. That evening she would try to get into Mr miller's cabin when he was at dinner and look for the red book. she would put the 1909 red book in its place

The next half hour could go badly wrong, and she was very nervous

She sat unhappily back in her chair.

I used to work closely with your father at the bank. When he realized that the police were coming for him, he decided to escape to America. 

He knew that Mr Miller had important friends in England. And he knew that he would never get a fair trial in Southampton 

I promised him that I would help you. 

I m planning to look for work in New York.

And she went down to the third class deck alone, checking that no one was following her.

He was using money from new customers to pay the old ones.

Hannah was trying not to cry.

She sat down, away from the shop window, and waited until the men had gone.

Hannah helped Mrs Easton out onto the deck for some air. She found her a chair to sit on and got her a cup of tea. 

So her father could be a problem for Mr Miller in America, as well in England. Mr frost knew to much , and Mr miller wanted to shut him up. Hannah realized that her father was in real danger.

On the tenth day of the journey, as Hannah and Leo were sitting in the lounge, there was an excited shout from outside. They ran out to see what it was.

He told the passengers that the ship was at Elli Island, across the river from the city. United State immigration officers would soon come onto the ship with immigration forms for the first and second class passengers.Those passengers could then enter the United States. Third class passengers had to wait in the Immigration Station on Ellis Island. Immigration officers would talk to them there.

As the passengers returned to their cabins, everyone was talking about the terrible news.

Hannah got on a boat that took her from Ellis Island across to the city.

11

I just need to know if you've spoken to Mrs Violet Frost or Mr Alfe Frost’ 

The opening of Miller's Bank is this afternoon at two o’clock

It was possible that Leo was working for Mr Miller. She didn't want to lead him to her father!

Was she brave enough to stand up at the opening and tell people about it? She hoped so.

As the church bell sounded ten, she heard steps behind her on the stone floor. She turned, and there was Leo.

 I think you and Mr Miller have followed me since I left Ellis Island?

They said they were planning to send you back to England

 So I said I was with Miller's Bank and you were coming to the bank opening.

The police tried to stop him as he got to the door.
