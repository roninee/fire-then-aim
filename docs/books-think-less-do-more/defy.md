### A Conversation with Dr. Sunita Sah 与 Sunita Sah 博士的对话

#### 1. What compelled you to write this book? 1. 是什么促使您写这本书的？

As a child, I believed what adults taught me: that being obedient was “good,” that authority figures were to be trusted, and that I should do as I was told and not make a fuss. But in school, I saw firsthand the way teachers could abuse their authority, physically assaulting “bad” students in the name of discipline or order. Later, as a college student, I read Stanley Milgram’s landmark study of obedience—in which many subjects complied with orders to administer what they believed were life-threatening electric shocks to another person. And I began to question what it meant to be “good,” and whether obedience really was something we should always strive for and celebrate.
小时候，我坚信大人们的教诲：服从就是“好”，权威值得信赖，应该听话，不要大惊小怪。但在学校，我亲眼目睹老师们滥用职权，以纪律或秩序的名义殴打“坏”学生。后来，我读了斯坦利·米尔格拉姆关于服从的里程碑式研究——其中许多受试者遵从命令，对他人施加他们认为会危及生命的电击。我开始质疑“好”的含义，以及服从是否真的值得我们一直努力追求和赞扬。

George Floyd’s murder in 2020 was another turning point for me. That day, I saw echoes of Milgram’s subjects from the 1960s in the rookie police officers who complied with the orders of their training officer. I realized that despite decades of historical lessons and research on influence, our propensity for obedience is still as strong and dangerous as ever.
2020年乔治·弗洛伊德遇害对我来说是另一个转折点。那天，我在那些服从训练警官命令的菜鸟警察身上，看到了米尔格拉姆在20世纪60年代的实验对象的影子。我意识到，尽管几十年来我们汲取了历史教训，也对影响力进行了研究，但我们的服从倾向依然强烈而危险。

I have always been passionate about fairness and justice, and the need to build an equitable world. Yet I have also always believed myself to be a compliant person. Throughout my life, the pressure to be “good” and obedient has often conflicted with my need to act in accordance with the values I hold most dear.
我一直热衷于公平正义，并致力于建立一个公平的世界。然而，我也一直认为自己是一个顺从的人。在我的一生中，“善良”和顺从的压力常常与我遵循自己最珍视的价值观行事的需要相冲突。

What I wanted, I realized, was to write a book that addressed that tension I felt. It would be the book I wished I’d had growing up: a handbook for defiance, a step-by-step strategy for learning how to defy when it matters most.
我意识到，我想要写一本书来解答我内心的那种紧张感。这将是我成长过程中梦寐以求的一本书：一本反抗手册，一个循序渐进的策略，教你如何在关键时刻学会反抗。

#### 2. How is this book different from other books on how to say no? 2. 这本书与其他关于如何说不的书有何不同？

This book draws from behavioral science. It is informed by my research and that of other scholars and offers a novel definition of defiance as a proactive *positive* force in our lives. Rather than viewing defiance as a single irrevocable act, which can be intimidating and prohibitive for those who need to defy, I break down the stages of defiance into five actions that are accessible to us all.
本书以行为科学为灵感，并结合我和其他学者的研究成果，对反抗提出了一个全新的定义：反抗是我们生活中一种积极主动*的正*能量。我不会将反抗视为一种不可逆转的单一行为，因为这可能会让那些需要反抗的人感到恐惧和畏惧。相反，我将反抗的五个阶段分解成五个我们每个人都可以参与的行动。

Defiance, in the popular imagination, is often seen as an attribute of extraordinary people who do courageous things. And certainly, within these pages, there are thrilling stories of people who defy. But a central concept of my book is that defiance doesn’t have to be loud to be effective—in fact, it usually isn’t. Defiance can be quiet and subtle, while still allowing us to move toward a better life, one that is more aligned with our values.
在大众的想象中，反抗常常被视为非凡之人、勇敢之人的特质。当然，本书也讲述了那些勇敢反抗者的精彩故事。但我书的核心理念是，反抗不必喧嚣才能有效——事实上，通常情况下并非如此。反抗可以悄无声息、潜移默化，同时仍然能让我们走向更美好的生活，一种更符合我们价值观的生活。

Being defiant is much more than just saying *no*. It is actually more about saying *yes*—to our values, to what we truly believe. My aim is to encourage readers to anchor their personal values in a broader social context: to examine how our everyday acts of compliance and dissent add up to the society we live in.
反抗远不止于说 *“不”* 。它实际上意味着说 *“是”* ——对我们的价值观，对我们真正相信的事物。我的目标是鼓励读者将个人价值观置于更广阔的社会背景中：审视我们日常的顺从和异议行为如何影响着我们所生活的社会。

And as I’ve learned, even those small acts of defiance can make a big difference—in our lives and in society at large.
正如我所了解的，即使是那些小小的反抗行为也能对我们的生活和整个社会产生重大影响。

#### 3. What do you hope this book does for readers? 3. 您希望这本书为读者带来什么？

I want this book to cultivate and nurture defiance in its readers—to show them that defiance doesn’t have to be loud, it doesn’t have to be oppositional, and most importantly, it is not the sole preserve of the larger-than-life heroes of history.
我希望这本书能够培养和培育读者的反抗精神——向他们表明反抗不必大声喧哗，不必采取对抗态度，最重要的是，它并不是历史上那些传奇英雄的专利。

We don’t even have to think of ourselves as “defiant” to access the power of a True No. That’s certainly been true for me. Even now, after all my research and practice, I don’t view myself as a person who can loudly and publicly defy. But I have learned to connect my values and my behavior more often, and I have realized I am defiant in my own unique way.
我们甚至不必认为自己“叛逆”，就能获得“真正拒绝”的力量。对我来说，这当然是事实。即使是现在，经过我所有的研究和实践，我也不认为自己是一个可以大声公开反抗的人。但我学会了更频繁地将我的价值观与我的行为联系起来，并且我意识到我以自己独特的方式展现着叛逆。

I hope this book will give readers a clear way to apply big principles to the smallest details of their lives. So many of us freeze in situations that don’t feel right. This book is designed to make defiance accessible to all, to recognize that we have more options than the automatic compliance often expected from us. It gives us an action plan for defiance, one that starts long before a moment of crisis.
我希望这本书能为读者提供清晰的方法，将重要的原则应用于生活中最细微的细节。我们很多人在感觉不对劲的情况下会不知所措。这本书旨在让每个人都能学会反抗，认识到我们拥有比通常被期望的自动顺从更多的选择。它为我们提供了一个反抗的行动计划，一个早在危机时刻到来之前就开始实施的计划。

Beyond personal transformation, this book is a call to action for a cultural shift. I envision a world where defiance is not just accepted but encouraged in our children, our friends, our family members, and in ourselves. A world inhabited by what I term “moral mavericks”—people who, guided by their core values, can embrace their responsibility and speak up, speak out, and demand change when necessary.
除了个人转变之外，这本书还呼吁人们采取行动，推动文化变革。我设想一个世界，在那里，反抗不仅被接受，而且被鼓励，无论是在我们的孩子、朋友、家人，还是在我们自己身上。这个世界里，居住着我称之为“道德特立独行者”的人——这些人在其核心价值观的指引下，勇于承担责任，在必要时敢于发声、敢于表达，并要求改变。

Ultimately, this book is more than just a guide; it’s a manifesto for the right to resist. My hope is to create a world in which everyone is free to defy.
归根结底，这本书不仅仅是一本指南，更是一份捍卫反抗权利的宣言。我希望创造一个每个人都能自由反抗的世界。

#### 4. Who is this book for? 4. 这本书适合哪些人阅读？

This book is for anyone who grew up being told to be “good,” to be polite, to not make a scene, and to do as they were told. It’s for those of us who have felt our voices silenced, who regret not taking action, who wonder why we did something that we did not agree with.
这本书献给所有在成长过程中被告知要“乖乖听话”、要有礼貌、不要吵闹、要听话的人。它也献给那些感到自己的声音被压制、后悔没有采取行动、疑惑自己为何做出不认同之事的人。

It is for anyone who has ever swallowed their objections, apologized for being themselves, pasted a false smile on their face, and said, *Okay*—even though it went against everything they valued and believed in.
它适合所有曾经忍住反对意见、为自己道歉、脸上挂着虚假的微笑并说 *“好吧”的人* ——即使这违背了他们所珍视和信仰的一切。

It’s for people who wonder why they stood by, why they couldn’t help.
它适合那些想知道为什么自己袖手旁观、为什么无法提供帮助的人。

It is for any of us who have been told that the world is not ours, who feel discriminated against or who have observed injustice, bias, sexism, racism, and bigotry. It is for anyone interested in empowerment and self-improvement.
它适合我们每一个人，无论他们是否被告知这个世界不属于我们，无论他们是否感到被歧视，无论他们是否目睹过不公正、偏见、性别歧视、种族歧视和偏执。它适合每一个渴望获得力量和自我提升的人。

It’s for parents teaching their kids to stick up for themselves and others. For workers learning to stand up to their bosses and question unfair or harmful policies. For activists, to understand what drives them and to avoid falling for false defiance. For managers, who want to make space for constructive dissent from their employees, and for policymakers who want to ensure that when we’re asked to sign our consent it really is our informed and freely given True Yes.
它适用于教导孩子捍卫自己和他人权益的父母；适用于学习如何对抗老板、质疑不公平或有害政策的工人们；适用于帮助活动家了解自身动力并避免陷入虚假反抗的人士；适用于希望为员工的建设性异议留出空间的管理者；也适用于希望确保我们在被要求签署同意书时，确实是在知情且自愿的情况下做出“真同意”的政策制定者。

*So many of us* struggle with defiance. We worry that we’ll make the wrong choice. We worry that we’ll get hurt. We worry that even if we defy, nothing will come of it—it won’t matter. The people profiled in this book—students and teachers, police officers and peace activists, professional athletes and nurses, engineers and managers, teenagers and parents—represent a veritable melting pot of occupations, races, cultures, ages, and life experiences.
*我们很多人都*在与反抗作斗争。我们担心自己会做出错误的选择。我们担心自己会受到伤害。我们担心即使我们反抗，也不会有任何结果——一切都变得无关紧要。本书中描述的人物——学生和教师、警察和和平活动家、职业运动员和护士、工程师和管理人员、青少年和家长——代表着一个名副其实的职业、种族、文化、年龄和生活经历的大熔炉。

Like defiance, this book is for everyone. We all need an education in how to enact our values under pressure. That’s what I’ve aimed to offer here. The research and experiences captured in this book have changed my life; my hope is that it will change yours, too.
就像反抗一样，这本书适合所有人。我们都需要学习如何在压力下践行自己的价值观。这正是我写这本书的目的。本书中的研究和经验改变了我的人生；我希望它也能改变你的人生。

### Appendix 附录

#### Part One

#### A True Yes



##### Chapter 1: Wired to Comply 第一章：顺从的本能

Many of us are conditioned into thinking about defiance as a simple binary:
我们中的许多人习惯于将反抗视为简单的二元对立：

- Compliance = Good
  合规性=良好
- Defiance = Bad
  反抗=坏

Breaking this binary requires that we see defiance as neither good nor bad in itself, but simply as a way for us to access our truest self and act on our core values.
打破这种二元性要求我们将反抗本身视为非善即恶，而只是一种让我们接触最真实自我并按照我们的核心价值观行事的方式。

##### Chapter 2: Tension Is Your Strength 第二章：紧张是你的力量

**Resistance to resistance** often manifests as tension: a deep discomfort arising when we find ourselves in a situation that calls for compliance, even though we would prefer to defy. We may experience it as nervousness, anxiety, or doubt.
**对抵抗的抵抗通**常表现为紧张：当我们发现自己身处需要顺从的境地时，即使我们更愿意反抗，也会感到深深的不适。我们可能会感到紧张、焦虑或怀疑。

When you feel tension, don’t discount it. Instead:
当你感到压力时，不要轻视它。相反，要：

- Examine it. How does it manifest? Is there a physiological component?
  检查一下。它是如何表现出来的？有生理因素吗？
- Ask yourself: What is causing me to feel this way?
  问问自己：是什么导致我有这种感觉？
- Am I living up to my values or compromising them?
  我是否践行了我的价值观或者违背了我的价值观？
- Am I uncomfortable because I want to defy?
  我是不是因为想反抗而感到不舒服？

Tension is not weakness. It is strength: your brain and body’s way of telling you that defiance might be necessary.
紧张并非软弱，而是力量：这是你的大脑和身体告诉你，反抗可能是必要的。

##### Chapter 3: Know Your True Yes 第三章：了解你的真心

Compliance and consent are two different things.
遵守和同意是两码事。

**Compliance** is reactive or passive obedience, largely dictated and imposed by the wishes of others.
**服从**是反应性的或被动的服从，很大程度上是由他人的意愿决定和强加的。

**Consent** is a thoroughly considered authorization that is an active expression of our deeply held values.
**同意**是经过深思熟虑的授权，是我们根深蒂固的价值观的积极表达。

For consent to be valid, it must satisfy five elements:
同意要有效，必须满足五个要素：

1. *Capacity*—Do I have the competence and cognitive ability to make this decision? Am I impaired in any way?
   *能力* ——我是否具备做出这个决定的能力和认知能力？我在这方面是否受到任何损害？
2. *Knowledge*—Do I have the information and facts I need to make this decision? Do I know the risks, benefits, and alternatives?
   *知识* ——我是否掌握了做这个决定所需的信息和事实？我是否了解其中的风险、好处和替代方案？
3. *Understanding—*Have I achieved an adequate understanding of the facts?
   *理解——* 我是否对事实有了充分的理解？
4. *Freedom—*Am I being coerced? Do I have the choice to say no?
   *自由——* 我被胁迫了吗？我可以选择拒绝吗？
5. *Authorization—*Does this decision align with my true values? If yes, give your informed consent, your True Yes. If not, give your informed refusal, your True No.
   *授权——* 这个决定是否符合我的真实价值观？如果是，请给予知情同意，即“真实同意”。如果否，请给予知情拒绝，即“真实拒绝”。

##### Chapter 4: Break Free from Influence 第四章：摆脱影响

Factors that can limit our ability to defy include:
限制我们抵抗能力的因素包括：

- **Insinuation Anxiety:** the concern, worry, or apprehension we feel about signaling a negative evaluation about another person to that person.
  **暗示焦虑：** 我们对向他人传达负面评价时产生的担心、担忧或忧虑。
- **Sales Pitch Effect:** the pressure we feel to avoid appearing unhelpful, uncharitable, or uncooperative to another person.
  **推销效应：** 我们感受到的压力，避免在别人面前显得无益、不仁慈或不合作。

Within each of us there are two ideals, often in conflict:
我们每个人心中都有两种理想，而且它们常常互相冲突：

- The *independent self,* which values autonomy, freedom, and individuality above all other considerations.
  *独立的自我，* 将自主、自由和个性置于所有其他考虑之上。
- The *interdependent self,* which prioritizes interpersonal harmony.
  *相互依存的自我，* 优先考虑人际和谐。

Balancing these competing ideals is an ongoing process, especially when it comes to defiance, where the social pressures to comply can be quite powerful.
平衡这些相互竞争的理想是一个持续的过程，尤其是在反抗时，社会对服从的压力可能非常强大。

##### Chapter 5: Reclaim Your Power 第五章：重夺你的力量

To lessen the social pressures keeping us compliant, get a little distance:
为了减轻让我们顺从的社会压力，请保持一点距离：

- *Physical* distance can insulate you from insinuation anxiety and the sales pitch effect.
  *物理*距离可以使您免受影射焦虑和推销效应的影响。
  - Step out of the room.
    走出房间。
  - Ask for a day to think things over.
    要求一天的时间来考虑事情。
  - Whatever you do, try not to make a decision in the moment.
    无论你做什么，尽量不要在当下做出决定。
- *Psychological* distance can also protect you from social pressures to comply.
  *心理*距离还可以保护你免受社会压力的困扰。
  - Name what you’re feeling—is it insinuation anxiety? Is it the sales pitch effect?
    说说你的感受——是暗示焦虑吗？还是推销效应？
  - Speak to yourself in the third person. Ask yourself:
    用第三人称自言自语。问问自己：
    - Does [say your name] really want to do this?
      [说出你的名字] 真的想这样做吗？
    - Is this what [say your name] really wants, or does [say your name] simply feel pressure to comply?
      这是 [说出你的名字] 真正想要的吗，还是 [说出你的名字] 只是感到了要遵守的压力？



#### Part Two

#### A True No



##### Chapter 6: Find Your True No 第六章：找到你真正的拒绝

A True No stems from connection with our core moral values such as shared humanity, equality, and fairness.
真正的“不”源于与我们共同的人性、平等和公平等核心道德价值观的联系。

Make sure you have the *capacity, knowledge, understanding,* and *freedom* to *authorize* a True No.
确保您拥有*授权* True No *的能力、知识、理解力*和*自由* 。

Prepare and practice for defiance by understanding the following stages of defiance.
通过了解反抗的以下阶段来准备和练习反抗。

![img](images/000006.webp)

1. *Tension,* which can manifest cognitively, emotionally, or physically in the body
   *紧张，* 可以表现为认知、情感或身体上的紧张
2. *Acknowledgment* of the tension and a consideration of why you feel it
   *承认*紧张并思考为什么你会有这种感觉
3. *Escalation* of your concern to others
   向其他人*表达*你的担忧
4. *Statement* that you will not comply
   *声明*您不会遵守
5. An act of *defiance*
   *反抗*行为

You don’t necessarily have to proceed through each of these stages in order for defiance to be possible. But understanding the progression from tension to action can allow you to reflect on your own journey to defiance—and to reassess, at each stage, how you wish to proceed.
你不必经历每个阶段才能真正做到反抗。但了解从紧张到行动的进展过程，可以让你反思自己的反抗之路，并在每个阶段重新评估自己希望如何继续下去。

Defiant action becomes much more likely after stage three: Once a person has decided to escalate their concern to others, it becomes more likely you’ll progress to stage five.
在第三阶段之后，采取反抗行动的可能性会大大增加：一旦一个人决定将自己的担忧升级到其他人，就更有可能进入第五阶段。

##### Chapter 7: The False Defiance Trap 第七章：虚假反抗陷阱

**False defiance** might *look* like defiance, but it does not arise from our true core values. Often, it is the product of knee-jerk opposition, moral convictions, or following the crowd.
**虚假的反抗**或许*看起来*像是反抗，但它并非源于我们真正的核心价值观。它往往源于下意识的反抗、道德信念或随波逐流。

**Moral convictions** can lead us to disregard the pressures and conventions keeping us from defiance—but they can also lead us to act in destructive and harmful ways that might violate our own values.
**道德信念**可以引导我们无视阻碍我们反抗的压力和传统，但也可以引导我们采取可能违背我们自身价值观的破坏性和有害的行为。

True defiance derives from our core values and highest principles, not our allegiance to a specific group, political party, or religious dogma.
真正的反抗源于我们的核心价值观和最高原则，而不是对特定群体、政党或宗教教条的忠诚。

##### Chapter 8: Who Gets to Defy? 第 8 章：谁能反抗？

In our world, some people are “allowed” to defy while others face harsher consequences for noncompliance. Social norms, conventions, and policies enforce a **defiance hierarchy** that mirrors larger divisions and inequities.
在我们的世界里，有些人被“允许”反抗，而另一些人则因不服从而面临更严厉的后果。社会规范、惯例和政策强制推行了一种**反抗等级制度** ，这反映了更大范围的分歧和不平等。

**Conscious compliance** helps us survive certain situations in which the costs of defiance might outweigh the benefits. Ask yourself:
**有意识地服从**可以帮助我们在某些情况下生存下来，因为反抗的代价可能大于好处。问问自己：

- What are the costs of defiance—physical, social, psychological, financial, health-related—in this situation?
  在这种情况下，反抗的代价是什么——身体上的、社会上的、心理上的、经济上的、健康的？
- Could defiance lead to positive change?
  反抗能带来积极的改变吗？
- Could the change outweigh the risks?
  这种改变是否能够抵消风险呢？

Conscious compliance is most effective as a short-term survival strategy. Remember that just as there are costs to defiance, there are also costs to continued conscious compliance.
自觉服从是最有效的短期生存策略。记住，正如反抗会有代价一样，持续自觉服从也会有代价。

##### Chapter 9: Quiet Defiance 第九章：静静的反抗

**Quiet defiance** is an act of defiance without vocal public declaration. It may work in situations that might be dangerous or in which the costs of compliance may be too high to bear.
**静默反抗**是一种不公开宣示的反抗行为。在危险的情况下，或顺从的代价高昂到难以承受的情况下，静默反抗或许能奏效。

A road map for **escalating defiance in institutions** can guide us to affect change.
**机构内不断升级的反抗**路线图可以指导我们实现变革。

![Escalating defiance in institutions: Advocacy; dissent; disobedience; principled exit.](images/000007.webp)

1. *Advocacy*—enacting your professional values as part of your regular duties
   *倡导* ——将你的职业价值观作为日常职责的一部分
2. *Dissent*—can be internal or public, and involves questioning particular actions or requests that do not align with your core moral values
   *异议* ——可以是内部的，也可以是公开的，包括质疑不符合你核心道德价值观的特定行为或要求
3. *Disobedience*—openly disobeying rules or laws that are causing clear harm
   *不服从* ——公开违反造成明显伤害的规则或法律
4. *Principled* *Exit*—leaving a situation, environment, or organization when its values do not align with your own
   *原则性**退出* ——当某个情况、环境或组织的价值观与你自己的价值观不一致时，离开它



#### Part Three

#### Becoming a Moral Maverick



##### Chapter 10: Who Am I? 第十章 我是谁？

When considering how to behave in a situation, especially if you feel tension, consider the three questions in the Defiance Compass.
当考虑在某种情况下如何行动时，特别是当你感到紧张时，请考虑“反抗指南针”中的三个问题。

![img](images/000008.webp)

**Self-connection** means getting in touch with your core values.
**自我连接**意味着与你的核心价值观取得联系。

It is *not:*
它*不是：*

- Allegiance to a cause
  忠诚于事业
- Membership in a party
  政党成员资格

It *is:*
这*是：*

- Understanding your own biases and rationalizations
  了解自己的偏见和合理化解释
- Seeing through your self-deceptions
  看透你的自欺欺人
- Knowing your true values
  了解你的真正价值观

Take the time to reflect, articulate, and write down your values.
花时间反思、表达并写下你的价值观。

When you are about to take an action you are unsure about, ask yourself the following questions:
当你准备采取不确定的行动时，请问自己以下问题：

- *Is this me?
  这是我嗎？*
- *Does this action represent my core values?
  这个行为代表了我核心价值观吗？*

##### Chapter 11: The Right Place and Time 第11章：天时地利人和

For every moment of defiance, we can assess the environment by asking: *What type of situation is this?*
对于每一个反抗的时刻，我们都可以通过问自己来评估环境： *这是什么样的情况？*

To answer it, ask yourself two further questions:
要回答这个问题，请再问自己两个问题：

- *Is it safe for me to defy?* (safety)
  *我违抗这些规定是否安全？* （安全）
- *Will this action make any difference?* (positive impact)
  *这项行动会带来什么影响？* （积极影响）

We cannot always control our environment, but we are often more effective than we think.
我们无法始终控制我们的环境，但我们往往比我们想象的更有效率。

**Small-scale defiance** develops our skills, increases our confidence, and prepares us to recognize the right time and place to defy.
**小规模的反抗**可以培养我们的技能，增强我们的信心，并让我们能够识别反抗的正确时间和地点。

The **defiance empathy gap** represents the discrepancy between people’s beliefs regarding the safety, ease, and effectiveness of defiance in a particular environment.
**反抗同理心差距**代表了人们对特定环境下反抗的安全性、轻松性和有效性的信念之间的差异。

Asking for clarification can **raise the volume** on a situation—and when you raise the volume, you can begin to transform it. Asking “What do you mean by that?” or “Do I understand you correctly?” are non-threatening ways to make your discomfort known and gauge the safety of further defiance.
要求澄清可以**提高情况的音量** ——而当你提高音量时，你就能开始改变它。问“你这是什么意思？”或“我理解得对吗？”是表达你的不适感并评估进一步反抗是否安全的非威胁性方式。

##### Chapter 12: The Superpower of Responsibility 第十二章：责任的超能力

We make decisions about defiance based on our answer to the question: *What does a person like me do in a situation like this?*
我们根据对这个问题的回答来决定是否反抗： *像我这样的人在这种情况下会怎么做？*

Answering this question involves assessing two main factors:
回答这个问题需要评估两个主要因素：

- Responsibility—*Is it my duty to defy? Do I have a responsibility to act on behalf of others or myself?*
  责任—— *我的义务是反抗吗？我有责任代表他人还是自己采取行动？*
- Ability—*How well-equipped am I for defiance? Do I have the confidence and skill to defy?*
  能力—— *我对抗的准备程度如何？我是否有信心和能力去对抗？*

Responsibility can enable us to tap into our defiant power. When we are responsible for others—our friends, our family—we often find it easier to defy.
责任能让我们发挥反抗的力量。当我们对他人——我们的朋友、家人——负责时，我们常常会发现，反抗会更容易一些。

##### Chapter 13: Level Up 第十三章：升级

Increase your *ability* to defy with **preparation and practice**:
通过**准备和练习**来提高你的抵抗*能力* ：

- **Anticipate** situations that might call for defiance and reflect on past experiences.
  **预测**可能需要反抗的情况并反思过去的经验。
- **Visualize** how you might act.
  **想象一下**您可能会采取什么行动。
- **Practice** by scripting and role-playing. Saying defiant words out loud allows our mouths to get used to speaking them and our ears to get used to hearing them. Engage in “small-scale” defiance—small defiant acts can lead to more change than you might anticipate.
  通过脚本和角色扮演**进行练习** 。大声说出反抗的话语，可以让我们的嘴巴习惯说出来，耳朵习惯听到。进行“小规模”的反抗——小小的反抗行为可能会带来比你预期更大的改变。
- **Repeat** as necessary.
  根据需要**重复** 。

*Anticipating, visualizing,* and *practicing* reduces surprise, which can disable defiance.
*预测、想象*和*练习*可以减少惊讶，从而可以消除反抗。

Hone your skills by considering past successful and not so successful defiance attempts and ask:
通过思考过去成功和不太成功的反抗尝试来磨练你的技能，并问自己：

- What enabled your defiance?
  是什么促使你反抗？
- What disabled it?
  什么原因导致它无法工作？
- What were the barriers to your defiance, and how could you mitigate them?
  您的反抗面临哪些障碍？您如何减轻这些障碍？

**Preparation and practice** are critical to changing how we might behave in a situation. Imagine if the McDonald’s managers had been forewarned about crank calls from a “police officer” asking them to strip search their employees.
**准备和练习**对于改变我们在特定情况下的行为至关重要。想象一下，如果麦当劳的经理们事先收到警告，说会有“警察”打来恶作剧电话，要求他们对员工进行脱衣搜身，那会是怎样的体验。

Just as The Talk provides young people of color with a context for understanding specific stressful encounters with the police, other types of talks could help prepare people for a range of different situations. For example, senior academics could forewarn junior colleagues about situations like the one I encountered as a postdoc. As one senior woman academic said at a conference workshop called *Yet, She Persisted,* “There is nothing wrong with you, but there is plenty wrong with the system.” We can remember that institutional failure is not individual failure.
正如“谈话”为有色人种的年轻人提供了一个理解与警察发生的具体压力冲突的背景一样，其他类型的谈话也能帮助人们应对各种不同的情况。例如，资深学者可以预先警告初级同事，避免我博士后时期遇到的类似情况。正如一位资深女学者在一个名为“ *然而，她坚持”的研讨会上所说：* “你本身没有问题，但这个体系有很多问题。” 我们应该记住，制度的失败并非个人的失败。

Just as Kevin the police officer anticipated that he would face ethical challenges in his line of work, we too can prepare ourselves and each other to understand that certain encounters are likely to come up, and they are not our fault. Parents could help their teenage children understand specific pressures that they might face and what a True Yes and a True No actually are. We can learn the difference between consent, conscious compliance, and defiance. And we can do all this without self-judgment and shame.
正如警官凯文预料到自己在工作中会面临道德挑战一样，我们也可以做好准备，也互相理解，某些情况可能会发生，而这些情况并非我们的错。父母可以帮助青少年理解他们可能面临的具体压力，以及什么是真正的“同意”和“不”。我们可以学习区分同意、自觉服从和违抗。而且，我们可以做到这一切，而无需自我评判和感到羞愧。

##### Chapter 14: You Don’t Have to Be Brave 第14章 你不必勇敢

There are many paths to defiance, but they all begin in the same place: one person connecting with their core values and then taking action; that action can be small.
反抗的道路有很多，但它们都始于同一个地方：一个人与自己的核心价值观联系起来，然后采取行动；这种行动可以很小。

**Moral mavericks** act on their core values, realize their responsibility to defy, and give their True Yes or their True No to try to create a better world.
**道德特立独行者**根据其核心价值观采取行动，认识到自己反抗的责任，并给出“是”或“否”的答案，以努力创造一个更美好的世界。

Defiance can change the world. But it also changes us. It makes us *more* ourselves. When we lean into what makes us unique, we can become defiant in our own ways, connecting with our aspirational selves: with both who we are and who we want to be.
反抗可以改变世界，但它也改变了我们，让我们*更加*真实。当我们拥抱那些让我们与众不同的特质时，我们就能以自己的方式展现反抗，与理想的自我连接：既包括我们是谁，也包括我们想要成为谁。

#### Conclusion: Dare to Defy 结论：勇于挑战

Give yourself the power of the pause.

Take a moment to step out of a challenging situation and reflect; walk away, talk to yourself, even take a deep breath before responding.
花一点时间摆脱困境并进行反思；走开，与自己对话，甚至在回应之前深呼吸。
