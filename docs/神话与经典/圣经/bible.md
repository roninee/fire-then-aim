So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.

神就照着自己的形象造人，乃是照着他的形象造男造女。

The person who sins is the one who will die. The child will not be punished for the parent’s sins, and the parent will not be punished for the child’s sins. Righteous people will be rewarded for their own righteous behavior, and wicked people will be punished for their own wickedness. 

谁犯罪，谁死亡。儿子不担当父亲的罪孽，父亲也不担当儿子的罪孽。义人的善果要归自己，恶人的恶报也要归自己。

Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God.

这样看来，我们各人一定要把自己的事在上帝面前交代。

So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.

上帝就照着他的形像创造人，照着上帝的形像创造他们；他创造了他们，有男有女。

For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.

神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不致灭亡，反得永生。

You will show me the way of life, granting me the joy of your presence and the pleasures of living with you forever.

你必将生命的道路指示我。在你面前有满足的喜乐；在你右手中有永远的福乐。

And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. 39No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.

因为我深信无论是死，是生，是天使，是掌权的，是有能的，是现在的事，是将来的事， 是高处的，是低处的，是别的受造之物，都不能叫我们与神的爱隔绝；这爱是在我们的主基督耶稣里的。
