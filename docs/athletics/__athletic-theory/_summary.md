## 如果疼痛酒没有意义

For that reason, it's crucial to look beyond the X's and O's of theoretical programming and instead, remember the most fundamental principle of intelligent training: minimizing risk while maximizing reward. Why? If your training leaves you beat up, broken down, and burnt out, it's only a matter of time until you and your results take a major hit.
因此，至关重要的是，我们要超越理论编程的繁琐细节，牢记智能训练的最基本原则**：最小化风险，最大化回报。**为什么？如果你的**训练让你精疲力竭、筋疲力尽，那么你和你的训练结果遭受重大打击只是时间问题。**

As Dr. Rusin has said, “*What's the point of being big and strong if you're always hurt and in pain?*” The answer is a no-brainer: there isn't one. Your deadlift numbers are meaningless if you throw out your back every time you sneeze, nor is your powerlifting total very impressive if you're being spoon-fed applesauce at age 52.
正如鲁辛博士所说：“ *如果你总是受伤、痛苦，那么强壮又有什么意义呢？* ” 答案显而易见：没有意义。如果你每次打喷嚏都会扭伤背部，那么你的硬拉成绩就毫无意义；如果你 52 岁了还在吃苹果酱，那么你的举重总成绩也毫无意义。

At the end of the day, health and longevity reign supreme (yes, even for high level sports performance). While getting stronger should be a primary goal for all individuals, there's no specific exercise or training modality that needs to be force-fed at the expense of short- or long-term health.
*归根结底，健康和长寿才是最重要的*（没错，即使对于高水平运动表现来说也是如此）。虽然增强体能应该是每个人的首要目标，但没有任何特定的锻炼或训练方式需要以牺牲短期或长期健康为代价来强制推行。

The added kicker? Unlike heavily-loaded barbell squats, loading up split squats with kettlebells, dumbbells, and/or weight vests places virtually zero stress on the spine.
额外的好处是什么？与负重杠铃深蹲不同，用壶铃、哑铃和/或负重背心进行*分腿深蹲几乎不会对脊柱造成任何压力。*

Plus, improving lower body function isn't just about minimizing injury risk. As a matter of fact, many common issues that split squats address are the same issues that bottleneck many lifters' strength numbers. This is one of the main reasons why Dr. Rusin includes so much single-leg work into his **[Functional Power Training](https://drjohnrusin.com/FPT)** and **[Functional Hypertrophy Training](https://drjohnrusin.com/FHT)**; beyond promoting pain-free training, split squats have a tremendous carryover to overall strength.
此外，改善下肢功能不仅仅是为了最大限度地降低受伤风险。事实上，分腿蹲能解决的许多常见问题，正是限制许多举重运动员力量提升的问题。这也是鲁辛博士在他的***功能性力量训练**和**功能性肥大训练**中加入大量单腿训练的*主要原因之一；除了促进*无痛训练*之外，分腿蹲还能极大地提升整体力量。

Going back to Boyle, the assumption is often made that he's against bilateral squatting, although that misinterpretation couldn't be further from the truth. On the contrary, he (as well as the guys at MBSC Thrive) programs goblet squats for both their athletes and their adults on a weekly basis. The difference lies in the method of loading – not in the execution of the pattern itself.
回到博伊尔，人们常常认为他反对双侧深蹲，尽管这种误解与事实相去甚远。恰恰相反，他（以及 MBSC Thrive 的教练们）每周都会为运动员和成年人安排*高脚杯深蹲*训练。区别在于负重方式，而非训练模式本身的执行。

Split squats have their fair share of muscle-building advantages, but that's not to say that the squat pattern doesn't have its own unique set of benefits. For starters, while the inherent need for stability and balance during split squat is a plus from a functional standpoint, it can be a potential downside when hypertrophy is the primary goal.
**分腿蹲**确实有不少增肌优势，但这并不意味着这种深蹲模式没有其独特的优势。首先，虽然分腿蹲对稳定性和平衡性的固有需求从功能性角度来看是优点，**但当以增肌为主要目标时，这可能是一个潜在的缺点**。

In this regard, the goblet squat is especially valuable for muscle-building purposes as it minimizes the inherent risks that accompany barbell squats, ensures good technique, removes otherwise limiting factors, and allows you to scale up the reps in order to absolutely tax the entire lower half (as anyone who has completed Dr. Rusin's **[goblet squat challenge ](https://drjohnrusin.com/relative-strength-goblet-squat-challenge/)**knows).
从这个角度来看，**高脚杯深蹲**对于肌肉锻炼来说尤其有价值，因为它可以最大限度地降低杠铃深蹲固有的风险，确保良好的技术，消除其他限制因素，并允许您增加重复次数，以绝对锻炼整个下半身（任何完成过 Rusin 博士的**[高脚杯深蹲挑战的](https://drjohnrusin.com/relative-strength-goblet-squat-challenge/)**人都知道）。
