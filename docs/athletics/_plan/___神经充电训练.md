#### *I've found nothing that works better than Neural Charge Training at increasing the rate of gains and enhancing recovery. You want to experience that? Here's how. 我发现没有什么比神经充电训练更能提高增肌速度和恢复速度。你想体验一下吗？方法如下。*

### Increased Frequency is Key 提高频率是关键

In the simplest terms, the key to maximum gains lies with increased training frequency and volume. Frequency and volume are obviously tied together, but of the two, frequency is by far the most important factor.
简而言之，获得最大收益的关键在于增加训练频率和训练量。频率和训练量显然是紧密相连的，但两者之中，频率无疑是最重要的因素。

I can accomplish everything I need to maximize gains through increased frequency, which in effect equates to also increasing volume. It’s far more effective, at the extreme level, to perform three 30-minute workouts per day than to do the same volume in one 90-minute workout.
我可以通过提高频率来实现最大化收益，这实际上也相当于增加了训练量。在极限水平上，每天进行三次30分钟的训练比一次90分钟的训练更有效。

Likewise, it’s more effective to spread the amount of time per week you devote to training over more days than fewer. For example, let’s say that you’re currently training four days per week for an hour each workout, a total of four hours per week.
同样，将每周的训练时间分散到更多天比更少天更有效。例如，假设你目前每周训练四天，每次一小时，每周总共训练四小时。

I’m telling you, from my experience, you’d make a lot better progress performing six 40-minute workouts per week. You’d make even greater progress training 35 minutes per day, seven days a week.
我告诉你，根据我的经验，每周进行六次40分钟的训练，你会取得更大的进步。如果每周七天，每天训练35分钟，你的进步会更大。

Face it, when we lift weights, all we’re doing is asking our body to react to the stimulus and grow muscle. Which would you rather do? Ask (stimulate) your body to grow four times per week or six times per week?
说实话，我们举重时，其实是在要求身体对刺激做出反应，从而增长肌肉。你更愿意选择哪种方式？是每周四次让（刺激）你的身体增长肌肉，还是每周六次？

“But won’t I overtrain working out that often?”
“但是我这么频繁地锻炼不会造成过度训练吗？”

You might be thinking that, so let me kill off this misconception right here and now.
您可能正在这么想，那么现在就让我消除这个误解。

I have worked with all kinds of responders, and increasing training frequency is exactly what works best even for those who can’t tolerate a lot of exercise. In fact, it’s the hardgainer who has the most to gain from increased frequency.
我和各种各样的人都合作过，即使对于那些无法忍受大量运动的人来说，增加训练频率也是最有效的方法。事实上，增肌困难者反而能从增加训练频率中获益最多。

As with all athletes, you have to know how to stimulate the maximum growth response with the minimum amount of neural fatigue. If you do that, provided you have the time, anyone can train seven days per week.
与所有运动员一样，你必须知道如何以最小的神经疲劳来刺激最大的生长反应。如果你能做到这一点，只要你有时间，任何人都可以每周训练七天。

### Neural Charge Workout 神经充电锻炼

1. **Perform 4-Exercise Circuit:** A Neural Charge Workout is comprised of 4 explosive exercises — 2 for the upper body and 2 for the lower body — that are performed in a circuit, alternating upper, lower, upper, lower (or visa versa).
    **进行 4 项练习循环：** 神经充电锻炼由 4 项爆发性练习组成 - 2 项针对上身，2 项针对下身 - 以循环方式进行，交替进行上身、下身、上身、下身（或反之亦然）。
2. **Use Explosive Rep Style:** Perform 3-5 explosive reps per set of each exercise.
    **采用爆发式重复方式：** 每组练习进行 3-5 次爆发式重复。
3. **Limit Workout to a Maximum of 20 Minutes:** Repeat the circuit continuously for no more than 20 minutes. The entire focus of NCT is performance, which means you should continue the circuit as long as performance levels are maintained. Depending upon exercise selection and residual fatigue going into the workout, you’ll typically get between 4 and 8 rounds of the circuit.
    **每次训练时间限制为最多 20 分钟：** 循环训练连续进行的时间不得超过 20 分钟。NCT 的重点在于运动表现，这意味着只要能保持运动表现，就应该坚持进行循环训练。根据训练动作的选择和训练前的残留疲劳程度，通常需要进行 4 到 8 轮循环训练。
4. **Avoid Metabolic Fatigue:** Avoid a racing heart rate and huffing and puffing at all costs. The goal is to stimulate muscle and performance gains and enhance recovery, NOT metabolic conditioning. So make sure your heart rate and respiration return to near-normal levels in-between sets. While waiting for the next set, walk around the gym, take a drink, keep moving. In other words, don’t sit down.
    **避免代谢疲劳：** 尽量避免心率过快和气喘吁吁。目标是刺激肌肉和运动表现，并促进恢复，而不是代谢调节。因此，请确保你的心率和呼吸在组间恢复到接近正常水平。在等待下一组训练时，在健身房里走走，喝点水，继续运动。换句话说，不要坐下来。
5. **Drop Exercises From Circuit:** If at any time, during a workout, you notice a decrease in performance of an exercise, immediately drop that exercise from the circuit and continue without it. Don’t be concerned if you end up having to drop all but one exercise. And if you’re down to one exercise and see a performance decrease in it, end the session.
    **停止循环训练：** 如果在训练过程中，你发现某个动作的效果下降，请立即停止循环训练，并继续进行。即使最后只剩下一个动作，其他动作也不必担心。如果你只剩下一个动作，并且效果下降，请立即结束训练。
