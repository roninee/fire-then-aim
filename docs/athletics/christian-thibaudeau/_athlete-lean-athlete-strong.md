- Workouts should emphasize strength, explosiveness and speed, and the capacity to maintain a high level of strength for an extended period.
  锻炼应强调**力量、爆发力和速度**，以及**长时间保持高水平**力量的能力。

## **The 3 Elements** 三大要素

当我想让一个人拥有健美的身材时，我会以提升这三个要素为基础来制定训练计划。

### **1. Getting “Athlete Strong”让“运动员变得强壮”**

Athlete strong is having a high level of general strength, not just excelling in a few specific lifts. Being strong on the basic barbell lifts will give you a very good head start in the strength department, but it takes more than that to be athlete strong. You need to be able to transfer your gym strength to real-life activities.
运动员力量指的是拥有高水平的综合力量，而不仅仅是在几个特定的动作上表现出色。在基础的杠铃动作上表现出色，会让你在力量方面领先一步，但要成为运动员力量，这还不够。你需要能够将健身房里的力量运用到实际生活中。

For this reason, you must 

#### 1) get stronger on a variety of barbell lifts covering the whole body and 

1) 通过多种覆盖全身的**杠铃举重**练习来增强力量

#### 2) get stronger using different versions of the loaded carry.

2) 使用不同版本的**负重行走**练习来增强力量。

### **2. Getting Explosive and Fast 爆发力和速度**

Being explosive and fast are two qualities that have a huge impact on your appearance. To call yourself explosive you need to be able to:
爆发力和速度是两个对你的形象影响巨大的特质。要想拥有爆发力，你需要具备以下能力：

- Jump high and far.
  跳得又高又远。
- Run fast. 快跑。
- Throw things a long way.
  把东西扔得很远。

When these are maximized, you will be lean and muscular.
当这些达到最大化时，你就会变得精瘦而肌肉发达。

Another important aspect of body composition training is various forms of jumps, throws, and sprints. These can be done for:
身体成分训练的另一个重要方面是各种形式的跳跃、投掷和短跑。这些训练可以用于：

- Maximal power output: Low-rep jumps, moderate-weight throws, or sprints of 60 meters or less
  最大功率输出：低重复跳跃、中等重量投掷或 60 米或更短的冲刺
- Maximal capacity output: Sets of jumps or throws lasting 45-60 seconds, sprints of 200-400 meters
  最大输出能力：45-60 秒的跳跃或投掷组，200-400 米的冲刺
- Overload: Weighted jumps, heavy throws, resisted sprinting
  超负荷：**负重跳跃**（高抓）、重投、抗阻力冲刺

All of the above will contribute to building a lean and muscular physique.
以上所有内容都有助于塑造精瘦而肌肉发达的体格。

 

### **3. Staying Strong for an Extended Period长期保持强势**

The leanest power athletes are those who can maintain a high level of power or force production for one or two minutes. Think of a 400-meter sprint, a gymnastic ring routine, or a round of boxing or MMA.
最精瘦的力量型运动员是那些*能够在一两分钟内保持高水平爆发力或力量输出的人*。想象一下 400 米短跑、体操吊环动作，或者一轮拳击或综合格斗比赛。

 

Athletes in power sports that require extreme power for only a brief moment, such as throwers and most Olympic lifters, typically aren't as lean. Even 100-meter sprinters, who are super lean and only run for 10 seconds, do a lot of 200, 300 and 400-meter sprints in their training.
从事力量型运动的运动员，比如投掷运动员和大多数奥运举重运动员，只需要在短时间内发挥出极强的力量，通常体型就没那么瘦。即使是 100 米短跑运动员，他们体型非常瘦，每次只跑 10 秒，也会在训练中进行大量的 200 米、300 米和 400 米短跑训练。

 

So to be very lean you not only need to be strong and powerful, you must be able to sustain your capacity over an extended period. That's where *loaded carries (extended strength)* and *explosive capacity work (jump and throw sets lasting 45-60 seconds, 200-400 meter sprints)* come into play.
所以，要想变得非常精瘦，你**不仅需要强壮有力，还必须能够长时间维持这种体能**。这时，*负重负重训练（扩展力量）和爆发力训练（45-60 秒的跳跃和投掷训练，以及 200-400 米冲刺）就能发挥作用*。

Another strategy is to use *complexes*. For example, doing a combination of three strength and/or power exercises back to back without rest.
*另一个策略是使用复合训练。例如，连续进行三项力量和/或爆发力练习的组合，中间不休息。*

 

**Diet 饮食**
You still need to establish a caloric deficit to lose fat. You can do that by restricting calories on a daily basis or by using the 5/2 Fat Loss Diet for Lifters that has you eating two lower calorie days a week (you establish your weekly deficit on those two days and can eat more on the other five).
你仍然需要建立热量缺口来减脂。你可以通过限制每日热量摄入来实现，或者采用“5/2 举重运动员减脂食谱”，每周两天低热量饮食（这两天建立每周热量缺口，其余五天可以增加摄入）。

 

However, the type of training you do profoundly affects how your body will look and how fast it will take you to get there. You should still strive to improve performance, even if you're consuming fewer calories than you need.
然而，你的训练类型会深刻地影响你的体型以及达到理想状态所需的时间。即使你摄入的卡路里低于所需，你仍然应该努力提高运动表现。

 

That's one reason I like the 5/2 approach when training like an athlete. It allows you to have a caloric deficit over the week, thus stimulating fat loss, while also having sufficient fuel to perform at a very high level and enough nutrients and calories to grow muscle.
这就是我喜欢像运动员一样训练时采用 5/2 方法的原因之一。它能让你在一周内保持热量缺口，从而刺激脂肪燃烧，同时还能获得足够的能量以保持高水平的运动表现，以及足够的营养和热量来增长肌肉。

 

**The Program 该计划**
Here's the exact program I use with my athletes. You may not have all the equipment to follow it to a “T” but you can still use this as a guideline for creating your own plan.
以下是我为运动员们制定的具体训练计划。你可能没有完全按照计划进行，但仍然可以参考它来制定你自己的训练计划。

This program has five lifting days and two days where you only work energy systems. These could also be off days, but fat loss will be a bit slower.
这个计划包含五天的举重训练，以及两天只进行能量系统训练。这些天也可以休息，但减脂速度会慢一些。

This program is ideally suited for the 5/2 diet but any eating style will work, provided optimal peri-workout protocols are followed. I strongly suggest Plazma™ before and during training and Mag-10® after training.
此计划非常适合 5/2 饮食法，但任何饮食方式均可适用，只要遵循最佳的训练前后方案。我强烈建议在训练前和训练中服用 Plazma™，并在训练后服用 Mag-10®。

Important. Decreasing or eliminating peri-workout carbs to expedite fat loss is a mistake. When trying to lose fat it's paramount that you do everything possible to maintain or improve performance. That's the only way to ensure that you're preventing muscle loss and triggering some lean mass gains.
重要提示：为了加速减脂而减少或完全不摄入运动前后的碳水化合物是错误的。想要减脂，最重要的是尽一切可能保持或提高运动表现。这是确保防止肌肉流失并促进瘦体重增长的唯一方法。

**Train Like an Athlete, Look Like an Athlete**
You’ll notice that there isn’t much variety in this program. The goal is to get you lean and mean, not carve out the coveted upper pec/front delt tie-in. When trying to drop a lot of fat to get super lean, you won’t build much muscle, so it doesn’t make sense to use a million lifting exercises.

 

The most important thing when trying to lose fat is to maintain (or even increase) your strength. If you can do that, then you won’t lose any muscle and might even add some. Doing garbage sets when trying to lose fat will just leave you tired and make it harder to keep your big lifts up.

 

This program has you lift, move, and train like an athlete to give you a body that looks, and is, powerful. Who doesn’t want that?
