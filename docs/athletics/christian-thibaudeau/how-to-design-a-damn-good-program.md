##  How to Design a Damn Good Program, Part 1

by Christian Thibaudeau


***Step 1: Determine your One Goal\***

**Like the man says, "If you don't know where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else."** In other words, unless you're absolutely clear about the one thing you want to accomplish with your training, you'll end up selecting the wrong loading parameters and training methods, and you won't get to where you want to be.

Let me give you an example. I hear variations of this all the time: ''*My goal is to become hyuuuuge, super strong, and ripped*." Is this your goal? Well, sorry to piss in your cornflakes, pal, but *that's not a goal, it's three goals*, and conflicting ones to boot. You simply can't do three different things at the same time. For maximum progress in any of these areas you have to focus on one major goal.

Let's look at how these goals conflict.

Trying to get both big and ripped at the same time should be a no-brainer. Maximizing muscle growth requires a caloric surplus. How much of a surplus depends on factors such as your body type, metabolism and current condition, but the fact remains that you must consume more calories than you expend. On the other hand, losing fat requires the opposite: a caloric deficit. You must expend more energy than you consume.

Food is the X-factor in whatever training you do. You can have the best training regimen in the world, bolstered by the most precise and advanced supplement protocol known to man, but if your diet is wrong for your goals, you'll probably never attain them. Let's all say it together one more time: Increasing muscular size requires caloric surplus. Losing fat requires caloric deficit. It ain't rocket science.

I'll grudgingly admit that it's possible to gain some muscle while losing some fat, for a short period of time, if you do everything perfectly. I imagine it's also possible to masturbate while riding a bicycle. In either case, though, *trying to do both at the same time only ensures that you'll do neither one very effectively.*

Similarly, trying to gain a lot of strength while losing a ton of blubber is an uphill battle. Your strength is determined as much by your neural efficiency as by your muscular development, so this is actually a bit more reasonable than trying for the hyuuuuge/ripped combination, but still, it's not easy.

Elite powerlifters and Olympic lifters usually post higher totals when they move up a weight class, and lower totals when they move down a weight class. This should be telling you something. If you really want to make marked and rapid progress in the strength arena, don't expect to do so while slimming down.

Which leads us to our last combination, getting big and strong at the same time. Of the three, this is the most realistic. However, training to maximize hypertrophy is fundamentally different from training to maximize strength, which focuses on making the central nervous system more efficient through the use of heavy weights and low reps.

While strength training can lead to muscular growth, the point is that your gains will not be as pronounced as they would be if you had concentrated on training for size. Once again, you must decide what's mostimportant to you (ripped, strong, or hyuuuuge), then make that priority the backbone of your training plan.

Once you've selected your One Goal, you need to stick with it long enough to make decent progress. If, for example, you concentrate on gaining mass for four weeks, then shift gears and focus on fat loss for another four weeks, guess what? You have an excellent chance of going nowhere.

Building muscle is a slow process. You will realistically gain between 0.25 and 0.5 pounds of lean mass per week, which means that by the end of your four-week "mass cycle" you will have "packed on beef" totaling a pitiful two pounds at the most. At least you won't have to go shopping for new clothes.

Be prepared to commit to your One Goal for a minimum of eight weeks, and preferably twelve. This doesn't mean that you have to stick to the same program for that length of time, but all programs you design for those *8 to 12 weeks* must be geared toward achieving your selected goal.


***Step 2. Select the right training split\***

Your training frequency and bodypart split is determined by your One Goal, your recovery capacity, and of course your schedule. In the table below, notice that the dominant structure (the system that plays the biggest role during your training) is different for each goal.

*Splits for Strength*

Training for strength or power primarily involves the central nervous system. The CNS is the slowest of the three structures to recover from intensive training, so the more CNS-dominant a program is, the more recovery days you'll need to maintain an optimum rate of progress.

However, there's more to it than that. Strength is a learned skill. It is the process of learning how to make the most of the muscles you already have. The more you use your muscles, the better you will become at recruiting them, and the more rapid your strength gains will be.

So when training for strength, you need to train each muscle group or movement pattern more often, while including more rest days (3 to 4) during the week. You can maximize your strength gains by using one of these splits:

因此，在进行*力量训练*时，你需要更频繁地训练每个肌肉群或动作模式，同时*每周安排更多休息日*（3到4天）。你可以使用以下分组来最大化你的力量提升：

A: Whole Body

Day 1: Whole body
Day 2: Recovery
Day 3: Whole body
Day 4: Recovery
Day 5: Whole body
Day 6: Recovery
Day 7: Recovery

B: Upper/Lower

Day 1: Lower body
Day 2: Upper body
Day 3: Recovery
Day 4: Lower body
Day 5: Recovery
Day 6: Upper body
Day 7: Recovery

C: Lower/Upper/Whole

Day 1: Lower body
Day 2: Recovery
Day 3: Upper body
Day 4: Recovery
Day 5: Whole body
Day 6: Recovery
Day 7: Recovery

D: Push/Pull

Day 1: Hamstrings + Pull
Day 2: Quads + Push
Day 3: Recovery
Day 4: Hamstrings + Pull
Day 5: Recovery
Day 6: Quads + Push
Day 7: Recovery


Splits for Size

When training for size, obviously the dominant structure is the muscular system. Because motor learning (learning to use your muscles) isn't as important here as it is for strength training, frequency per muscle group doesn't need to be as high, although each muscle can be hit twice a week. And because muscles recover faster than the CNS, you can get away with fewer recovery days: 2 to 3 per week is enough, provided that you carefully plan your training volume. The following splits are effective toward this aim:

在进行增肌训练时，肌肉系统显然是主导结构。由于运动学习（学习运用肌肉）在这里不像力量训练那么重要，因此每个肌肉群的训练频率无需太高，尽管每块肌肉可以每周训练两次。而且由于*肌肉的恢复速度比中枢神经系统快，你可以减少恢复日数*：只要你仔细规划训练量，每周2到3天就足够了。以下分组训练有助于实现这一目标：

E: Antagonist

Day 1: Chest/Back
Day 2: Recovery
Day 3: Biceps/Triceps
Day 4: Quads/Hamstrings
Day 5: Recovery
Day 6: Anterior and lateral delts/Rear delts
Day 7: Recovery

F: Pattern

Day 1: Quads dominant
Day 2: Horizontal push and pull
Day 3: Recovery
Day 4: Hips dominant
Day 5: Recovery
Day 6: Vertical push and pull
Day 7: Recovery

G: Synergistic

Day 1: Quads dominant
Day 2: Pull (back, biceps, rear deltoids)
Day 3: Recovery
Day 4: Hips dominant
Day 5: Recovery
Day 6: Push (chest, triceps, deltoids)
Day 7: Recovery

H: Upper/Lower

Day 1: Lower body
Day 2: Upper body
Day 3: Recovery
Day 4: Lower body
Day 5: Recovery
Day 6: Upper body
Day 7: Recovery

Splits for Fat Loss

When training for fat loss, you have much more leeway. Because you'll be including more metabolic work (lactate training like circuits, complexes, GPP work etc.), you won't need as much recovery time between training sessions. The tradeoff here is that you'll be consuming a caloric deficit, which impairs your ability to recover.

So while the number of recovery days you'll need is higher (3 to 4 per week), recovery in this case just means, "don't work too hard." You can still do some cardio or other low-intensity physical activity such as walking, to help your fat loss effort along.

As I said, it's hard to gain much strength when training to lose fat. However, you should still include 1 or 2 strength sessions per week during your fat-loss stage, just to hold onto as much muscular mass and strength as you can. Read my Destroying Fat article for more on designing a fat-loss program.


***Step 3. Select the proper training zone
\***
One of the key factors in stimulating the kind of gains you want is selecting the proper training intensity zone.

Your body adapts to the demands you place upon it. As long as you attempt to progressively add more weight to the bar, practically any training zone or method you use will lead to gains in both strength and size. However, because you want to concentrate only on size or strength, you need to select the training zone that will give you the most gains for your chosen goal. *If your goal is strength, for example, you would select sets of 1-3 reps rather than sets of 12-15 reps.*

Use the following table to select the proper training zone for each exercise, according to your One Goal. A properly designed fat loss program needs to include different approaches, which again are covered in Destroying Fat.

***Step 4. Select the number of sets for each muscle group
\***
The total number of sets in your program will vary depending on your work capacity, lifestyle, diet, and other factors. Generally speaking, you should be doing between *6 and 16 sets per muscle group*, and in fact *most trainees* make good progress keeping to a range of *9 to 12 sets.* If you're doing that many sets and still not properly stimulating your muscles, it may just mean that you're being a pussy, and should increase your intensity and effort.

You disagree? You say that you can bust your ass for more than 12 sets, and still recover from that volume? Well, maybe, maybe not. Some people can, but these folks are the rare exceptions, and you'd do well to assume that you're not one of them. I know, this can be a blow to your ego. We all like to believe that we are special and tough. Remember, though, that it's one thing to survive a brutal workout, and another thing to recover and grow from it.

Start in the 9 to 12 set range, stick with it for a while, and really give it all you've got in every set. Once you've given that volume an honest chance, evaluate how your body is responding. If you're positive that you can handle more volume, then you have my permission to increase it.

Remember, too, that 9 to 12 sets for each muscle group is a general guideline. If you have a low work capacity, or a busy schedule, you may need to adjust this range downward to between 6 and 9 sets. On full body days, you should be doing even fewer sets per muscle group (as low as 4 to 6), because of the hefty demands such a workout places on your body.


***Step 5. Select the right number of exercises for each muscle group\***

You can train hard, or you can train long. To gain as much strength or size as possible, **you need to emphasize the quality of your training rather than the quantity**, which *means excess volume*.

你可以刻苦训练，也可以长时间训练。为了尽可能地增强力量或肌肉块头，你需要注重训练质量而非数量，这意味着要减少训练量。

Of course you need a certain level of volume to stimulate growth and strength, but more is not always better. Training beyond your body's capacity to recover in a session, or continuing to exercise even when your fatigue level makes further training redundant and counterproductive: these are the fastest ways to halt your progress in its tracks.

Transforming your body is a highly emotional issue. Your gut feeling is that the more you train, the better you'll get. If you just add one more exercise, or two or three, then you can be sure to hit every area of every muscle in your body, and success is guaranteed. Nothing could be more wrong. Being driven to succeed is great, but if you are being driven by your emotions, you are on the high road to zero results.

**改变体型是一件高度情绪化的事情**。*你的直觉告诉你，训练得越多，效果就越好*。只要你再增加一个、两个或三个练习，就能确保锻炼到身体的每一块肌肉，成功也就指日可待了。*这绝对是错的*。渴望成功固然很好，*但如果你被情绪所驱使，那么你只会走上一条通往零的康庄大道。*

Do between **4 to 6 exercises total per training session**. If you're training two muscle groups in a session, this means you can do up to 3 movements for each muscle group. If you are training three muscle groups, you do 1 or 2 movements each, and if you are training the whole body, only one exercise per muscle group is allowed. Pretty simple math, right?

每次训练总共进行4到6个动作。如果你在一次训练中训练两个肌肉群，这意味着你每个肌肉群最多可以做3个动作。如果你训练三个肌肉群，则每个肌肉群可以做1到2个动作；如果你训练全身，则每个肌肉群只能做1个动作。很简单的计算，对吧？

In some sessions you may need to perform more than 6 exercises (in circuit training, for example), and in some sessions you will perform as few as 2 or 3. But 90% of the time, between 4 and 6 exercises is the place you want to be.

When training for strength, you do more sets of each exercise to maximize neural adaptation. Conversely, when training for size and aesthetics you perform more exercises for balanced muscular development.

当进行*力量训练时，你会进行更多组数的练习*，以最大限度地提高神经适应能力。相反，当进行体型和美感训练时，你会进行更多组数的练习，以促进肌肉的均衡发展。

**Strength = Fewer Exercises, More Sets**

**Size = More Exercises, Fewer Sets**

Remember that we only have between 9 and 12 sets to spend on each muscle group. Use the table below to find the number of sets and exercises to use for your goal and training split. For example, if your goal is strength, and you're on a push/pull split training three muscle groups per session, then you would do 2 exercises per muscle group, for 4 to 6 sets per exercise.



*Note that you don't have to use the same number of sets for all the exercises in a training session. You may spread the volume in a variety of ways. Here is an example:

2 exercises per muscle group, 10 sets total:

First exercise: 5 sets
Second exercise: 5 sets
First exercise: 6 sets
Second exercise: 4 sets
First exercise: 7 sets
Second exercise: 3 sets

The first exercise should always have the same or higher volume as the other movements.
*第一个动作的组数必须等于或大于后面的动作。*——这里意思是同一个肌群的第一个动作，很好理解，因为第一个是Primary 动作


***Step 6. Select the proper exercises
\***
Exercises fall into one of four categories. You select exercises from each category, according to the training effect you want.

Primary exercises: This category includes a small number of multi-joint, multi-muscle, free-weight and preferably multi-plane movements. These movements allow you to use the most weight for each muscle group, and place the highest demand on the body and nervous system.



Secondary exercises: Similar to the above, except that the exercises in this category place a slightly lower demand on the body and CNS.

Auxiliary exercises: This very broad category includes the isolation movements and most machine exercises. These exercises allow the use of considerably less weight than exercises in the first two categories, and so place far less demand on the nervous system.

Remedial exercises: This category contains movements, mostly isolation, whose purpose is to correct problems such as muscle imbalances or a very specific weak points. Rotator cuff work, balance and proprioception drills also fall into this category.

When your One Goal is strength, you should stick mostly to primary and secondary exercises in your program: they will give you the most bang for your buck. You can include two primary movements per muscle in a training session, but I don't recommend it, as it can wreak havoc on the nervous system when working in the low rep/heavy weight zones. You would be better off with one primary and one secondary.

如果你的目标是力量训练，那么你的训练计划中应该主要包含*主要动作和次要动作*：它们能让你获得最大的收益。你可以在一次训练中为每块肌肉安排*两个主要动作，但我不建议这样做*，因为在低次数/大重量区域训练时，*这可能会对神经系统造成严重损害。你最好安排一个主要动作和一个次要动作。*

The downside of these big compound exercises is that they tend to play to your strengths, bypassing your weaknesses. When performing a movement involving several muscle groups, your body will find the most economical solution, shifting most of the workload onto the stronger, more dominant muscles.

*这些大型复合训练的缺点是，它们往往会发挥你的优势，而忽略你的弱点*。当你进行涉及多个肌肉群的动作时，你的身体会找到最经济的解决方案，将大部分训练负荷转移到更强壮、更占主导地位的肌肉上。

The classic example is the bench press: if your shoulders are dominant, the bench press likely won't do much for your chest because your body will thriftily bypass your wimpy pectorals, shifting most of the workload onto the stronger front deltoids and triceps.
**典型的例子**就是卧推：如果你的肩膀占主导地位，卧推可能不会对你的胸部产生太大的影响，因为你的身体会巧妙地绕过你那虚弱的胸肌，将大部分工作量转移到更强壮的前三角肌和肱三头肌上。

If you are training to build a good looking, complete physique, then you should be using plenty of auxiliary exercises to make sure that the targeted muscles have been fully stimulated. Still, be sure to include a primary and at least one secondary exercise in your program.
如果你的训练**目标是打造美观、完整的体格**，那么你应该进行*大量的辅助练习*，以确保目标肌肉得到充分刺激。不过，一定要在你的训练计划中包含一个主要练习和至少一个次要练习。

If you are training for strength, and have a specific weakness such as a rotator cuff problem, feel free to add a remedial exercise. Because its intensity will be low, you don't have to count it in your total.
如果你正在进行力量训练，并且有特定的弱点，例如肩袖问题，可以随意添加一个补救练习。由于其**强度较低，你不必将其计入总训练量。**

The most important consideration in exercise selection is to avoid exercise redundancy. Your body has a limited capacity to recover from physical stress, so it would be stupid to piss away your precious recovery capacity on a redundant exercise.
选择运动时最重要的考虑因素是*避免重复练习。身体从身体压力中恢复的能力有限，所以把宝贵的恢复能力浪费在重复练习上是愚蠢的。*

Redundant exercises are those that work the same muscle group, using the same movement pattern, with the same grip. For example, the bench press, flat dumbbell press, flat machine bench press and Smith machine bench press are all just superficial variations of the same exercise. So are the standing barbell curl, standing supinated (palms up) dumbbell curl and standing cable curl. You get the idea, right? If you're going to select a number of exercises for one muscle group, then pick the ones that complement — not copy — one another.
冗余练习是指那些锻炼同一肌肉群、使用相同动作模式和相同握法的练习。**例如，卧推、平板哑铃卧推、平板器械卧推和史密斯器械**卧推都只是同一练习的简单变体。**站姿杠铃弯举、站姿仰卧（掌心向上）哑铃弯举和站姿绳索弯举也一样**。你明白了吧？如果你要针对一个肌肉群选择一些练习，那么请**选择那些相互补充（而不是相互复制）的练习。**

One last point about exercise selection: avoid indirect overload. I see a lot of people designing lower body routines like this one:

A. Back squat
B. Good morning
C. Front squat
D. Dumbbell romanian deadlift
E. Leg extension
F. Reverse hyperextension

On paper this looks fine. All are pretty good movements and it seems that the emphasis is placed on the money exercises. However, *~~this is a pretty stupid combination~~*. Why? Because with the exception of the leg extension, every single one of these movements will significantly overload the lower back.

Now, there's nothing wrong with having a strong lower back. But think about what condition your lower back is going to be in once you've done your squats and good mornings. Completely fried, and it'll be nearly impossible to do the rest of the workout with any sort of quality. You won't be able to perform your front squats with an upright torso, and your Romanian deadlift and reverse hyper will both be crap, because the prime mover is dead tired.

A word to the wise should be enough. Choose your exercises carefully, with as little cross-over as possible, and maximize performance throughout your workout.



##  How to Design a Damn Good Program, Part 2

by Christian Thibaudeau*[/B]

***Step 7. Select the proper exercise pattern
\***
Exercise distribution within a workout has two components:

1. Basic structure (horizontal/straight sets, alternating, vertical/circuit)



2. Exercise order within a chosen structure


The basic structure of the program is how you perform each exercise or set in relationship to the others.


Horizontal/straight sets structure

This is your ''usual'' distribution pattern, whereby you perform all the sets of an exercise before moving on to the next. For example:

A. Bench press

4 x 10
90-second rest interval

B. T-bar row

4 x 10
90-second rest interval

In this routine, you'd perform all four sets of the bench press (with 90 seconds of rest between sets) before moving on to the T-bar row.


Alternating structure

This approach, popularized by coach Poliquin, has the advantage of letting you do more work with less rest, without sacrificing performance (I also like it because it lets me get out of the gym that much quicker!). In this distribution pattern, you alternate sets between a pair of exercises that target different muscle groups ideally an agonist/antagonist pair. For example:

A1. Bench press

4 x 10
45 sec. of rest

A2. T-bar rowing

4 x 10
45 sec. of rest

In this case you'd perform one set of A1 (bench press), rest for 45 seconds, perform one set of A2 (T-bar row), rest for 45 seconds, then go back to A1 and repeat until you've performed 4 sets of each exercise. The actual rest intervals between two sets of bench press are about the same as with straight sets, even though you're only resting for 45 seconds.


Vertical/Circuit structure

Here you perform one set of three or more exercises one after another, in a circuit, then repeating the circuit if necessary. For example:

A1. Dumbbell bench press

12 reps
30-second rest interval

A2. Dumbbell squat

12 reps
30-second rest interval

A3. Seated row

12 reps
30-second rest interval

A4. Dumbbell Romanian deadlift

12 reps
30-second rest interval

A5. Preacher curl

12 reps
30-second rest interval

Note that a circuit doesn't have to be composed of all the exercises in your workout. You can perform a circuit of four exercises, for example, then two normal exercises performed in either an alternating or straight set fashion.

Circuits are best suited for body composition/fat loss training where you keep your intervals down to as little as 10 seconds between stations. But circuit training is also a highly efficient way to train for strength and power as well by increasing the intervals to as much as 2 or 3 minutes. This allows you to perform far more work in less time than it would take for straight or alternate sets, while still having plenty of recovery time between sets of the same exercise.


Exercise order

Once you've chosen your training structure you need to arrange the exercises you've chosen in a logical and effective order.

The most important rule to remember is the most neurally demanding exercises for a muscle group should be performed before the less demanding ones. For example, you should perform the squat earlier in the workout than a leg extension. There are few exceptions to this rule, one being when you want to pre-fatigue a hard-to-recruit muscle by isolating it before a compound movement.
*要记住的最重要的规则是，对肌肉群神经要求最高的练习应该先于要求较低的练习进行。*

Take all the exercises for one muscle group and arrange them in order of difficulty. For example, if you've selected the following exercises for your chest:

Cable crossover
Bench press
Dumbbell incline press

Then the correct order would become:

Bench press
Dumbbell incline press
Cable crossover

Rule of thumb: primary exercises before secondary, which go before auxiliary, which go before remedial ones. If you have two exercises from the same category (i.e. two primary or two secondary exercises), the exercise in which you use the most weight goes first.
经验法则：先进行主要练习，再进行次要练习，次要练习先进行辅助练习，辅助练习先进行补救练习。如果你有两个属于同一类别的练习（即两个主要练习或两个次要练习），则先进行你使用重量最大的练习。

Depending on the structure (horizontal, vertical, alternating) you use, the actual order of exercises might change.

If you're using straight sets you can either perform all exercises for the same muscle group one after the other, then move on to the next muscle group. In this case the order would be:
如果你使用连续训练，你可以先连续**完成同一肌肉群的所有练习，然后再进行下一个肌肉群的练习**。在这种情况下，顺序如下：

A. Chest primary
B. Chest secondary
C. Chest auxiliary
D. Triceps primary
E. Triceps secondary
F. Triceps auxiliary

This is okay if you're training one large muscle group (chest, back, or quads) and one or two small muscle groups in a workout. If you're training two large muscle groups (e.g. chest and back), it's not the best option, as the CNS will be fried by the time you get to the second muscle group.
如果你一次训练一个大肌肉群（胸部、背部或股四头肌）和一两个小肌肉群，那么这种方法没问题。**但如果你训练两个大肌肉群（例如胸部和背部），这种方法就不太好，因为**当你训练到第二个肌肉群时，你的*中枢神经系统（CNS）已经处于疲劳状态。*

If you're training two or more large muscle groups, or your whole body, then it's better to arrange all the exercises in order of difficulty, regardless of the muscle being trained. First group all of the exercises by category (primary, secondary etc.), and then order them so that the larger muscles are being worked first. In this example, you have chosen the following exercises for your full-body workout:
如果你训练的是两个或多个大肌肉群，或者全身，*那么最好按难度顺序安排所有练习，无论训练的是哪块肌肉*。首先将所有练习按类别（主要肌肉、次要肌肉等）分组，然后按顺序排列，以便先锻炼较大的肌肉。在本例中，你选择了以下练习进行全身锻炼：

Bench press
Military press
Chin-up
Front squat
Romanian deadlift
Barbell curl

All of these are primary exercises, so they should be ordered according to the size of the muscle involved, like so:

A. Front squat
B. Romanian deadlift
C. Chin-up
D. Bench press
E. Military press
F. Barbell curl

If you've also selected secondary exercises, the same rule applies: group by category (primary before secondary), then order the exercises in each category according to the size of the muscle group involved. For example, say you choose to use:

Bench press (primary)
Leg press (secondary)
Bent-over barbell row (primary)
Seated DB press (secondary)
Snatch-grip deadlift (primary)
Hammer curl (secondary)

You first group the exercises by category:

Primary movements:

Snatch-grip deadlift
Bent-over barbell row
Bench press

Secondary movements:

Leg press
Seated DB press
Hammer curl

Then arrange by muscle group size:

A. Snatch-grip deadlift
B. Bent-over barbell row
C. Bench press
D. Leg press
E. Seated DB press
F. Hammer curl

If you're using the alternating structure (most often with an antagonist split), then your first step is to order the exercises for each muscle. For example, let's say that you're working chest and back and you select these exercises:

Chest

Decline dumbbell flies
Decline bench press
Incline dumbbell press

Back

Lat pulldown to front
Bent-over barbell row
Chest-supported rear deltoid raise

The correct order for each muscle becomes:

Chest

A. Decline bench press
B. Incline DB press
C. Decline DB flies

Back

A. Bent-over barbell row
B. Lat pulldown
C. Chest-supported rear deltoid raise

Since the workout calls for an alternating exercise structure, the workout looks like this:

First exercise pairing

A1. Decline bench press
A2. Bent-over barbell row

Second exercise pairing

B1. Incline DB press
B2. Lat pulldown

Third exercise pairing

C1. Decline DB flies
C2. Chest-supported rear deltoid raise

Finally, if you're doing a circuit structure, you have a number of options depending on your goal.

In a strength, size, or power circuit with relatively long rest intervals between stations, the same rule applies as for straight sets: group by category, then order by muscle group.

In a lactate-inducing circuit aimed at fat loss, which jumps from one exercise to the next with very little rest in between, you're taxing your metabolic system rather than your nervous system, so exercise order is somewhat less critical.

However, you should be careful to arrange the exercises in such a way that they don't interfere with each other, alternating exercises to minimize the cross-over effect. For example, if your first exercise is a seated dumbbell shoulder press, following it with a bench press variation would not be a very good idea because this exercise hits the same muscle groups.


Priority exercises

The Olympic lifts (snatch, clean and jerk) and their respective variations always precede every other exercise in your program.

These exercises, involving the whole body in a complex movement pattern that rely heavily on the CNS, must be prioritized whenever they are included in your program. This may seem obvious, but I've seen programs for professional sports teams that prescribed snatches afterdeadlifts, squats, bench presses and rows! Ouch!

Remember: when you're using the Olympic lifts in a program, always put them first. If you perform more than one lift, snatches should come before cleans, which should come before jerks. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember the correct order:


"My snatch is clean, you jerk!


***Step 8. Selecting rest intervals
\***
The amount of rest between sets is directly dependent on your One Goal. Remember these rules:

1. The nervous system takes longer to recover than the muscles and metabolic processes.
   **神经系统的恢复时间比肌肉和代谢过程更长。**

2. Incomplete recovery of the metabolic processes can increase growth hormone production and might have significant body composition effects. Incomplete recovery can also force the body to recruit more motor units, although they might be of the slow-twitch variety. If all you're after is size, though, this could be interesting.

3. Complete CNS recovery is necessary for optimal strength performance. So if you're training for strength, you'll need to take longer rest periods to maximize the quality of your lifting efforts.


The right interval length depends on the intensity of your efforts, as well as on the exercise performed (you recover faster from a set of triceps kickbacks than from a set of squats). The following table illustrates the impact of various rest intervals:


Depending on your One Goal and the intensity zone you select, the ideal rest intervals would be:

Relative strength zone (1-3 reps): 3-4 minutes*

Absolute strength zone (3-5 reps): 2-3 minutes*
**绝对力量区（3-5 次）：2-3 分钟***

Functional hypertrophy zone (6-8 reps): 90-120 seconds*

Hypertrophy zone I (9-10 reps): 60-90 seconds*

Hypertrophy zone II (11-12 reps): 45-60 seconds*

Strength-endurance zone (13-20 reps): 30-45 seconds*

Endurance-strength zone (more than 20 reps): 30 seconds or less

\* between sets of a single exercise

Again, these are guidelines. Some people need less rest while others need more. For the great majority, this will work fine, so start there and adjust as needed.

Notice that I say "between sets of a single exercise." This means that if, for example, you're working in the hypertrophy zone you'd need to take 60 to 90 seconds of rest before performing a second set of the same exercise. For straight sets, this is quite straightforward:

A. Bench press

4 x 10 reps
90-second rest interval

Four sets of ten reps each, resting 90 seconds between each set. Piece of cake (or steak, if you prefer).

If you're doing alternating sets, it's a bit more complicated, but not much. Let's alternate bench press with T-bar row:

A1. Bench press

4 x 10

A2. T-bar row

4 x 10

We still need 90 seconds of rest (time spent not exercising) before starting a second set of the same exercise. We can get this by putting a 45-second rest interval between exercises.

A1. Bench press

4 x 10
45 seconds of rest

A2. T-bar rowing

4 x 10
45 seconds of rest

Now we have 90 seconds between each set of bench press, and 90 seconds between each set of rows. But our workout density is higher, which gives the session a more profound metabolic (fat loss and body composition) effect.

If you're circuit training for fat loss, you'll be working in the strength-endurance zone. If so, simply use the interval length specified above 10-45 seconds) between each station. Lactate-inducing circuit training should be considered energy system work (cardio) with weights, rather than "weight lifting."

***Step 9. About recovery days\***

I don't care how tough you think you are, or how hardcore you fancy yourself to be. The basic rules of physiology still apply to you. One of those rules is that muscular growth does not occur in the gym. In the history of mankind, nobody has ever packed on a pound of beef while training.
不管你自以为有多强，也不管你自诩有多硬核，**生理学的基本规律仍然适用于你。其中一条就是，肌肉增长并非发生在健身房里。在人类历史上，从来没有人在训练中增重一磅。**

When you stagger home from the gym after your workout, you're actually worse off then you were before you started: you damaged your muscles, depleted your energy stores, and fatigued your nervous system. It's only when you let your body recover that progress of any kind starts to happen.

During the recovery period, your body will rebuild its muscle tissue bigger and stronger (muscle hypertrophy or tissue remodeling), it will restore and even over-replenish its energy stores (surcompensation) and the nervous system will become more efficient at recruiting motor units (neural efficiency). In other words, all the good stuff happens when you're not training.

However, a lot of people don't give their bodies enough recovery days to let that progress set in.

I have a theory about why this is, and once again, it goes back to the fact that training is an emotionally-charged activity. We can be so impatient when it comes to building the body of our dreams. We want to be big and ripped with superhuman strength, and we want it now!
**我对此有一个理论**，再次强调，这可以归结为训练本身就是一种**充满情感的活动**。当我们想要拥有梦想中的身材时，我们**很容易缺乏耐心**。我们渴望拥有超人般的力量，拥有健美的体魄，而且现在就想要！

The more passionate we are about our dream, the more irrational we become, and the more work we're willing to do in the gym. We can't help it, we were raised to believe that the more time we spend on something, and the harder we work on it, the better the results will be.
**我们对梦想越是充满热情，就越会变得不理性**，也就越愿意在健身房里付出更多。我们无法控制自己，**从小就被灌输这样的观念**：在某件事上投入的时间越多，付出的努力越多，结果就会越好。

Our parents and teachers exhorted us to exert ourselves at our studies until exhausted. Our coaches filled our ears with pithy slogans like, "success only comes before work in the dictionary!" And when we went off to work, we soon learned that the longer hours we put in, the fatter our paychecks became. Who can blame us for thinking that the same would apply to training?
父母和老师告诫我们要努力学习，直到筋疲力尽。教练们则在我们耳边灌输诸如“字典里只有成功比工作重要！”之类的精辟口号。**而当我们去工作时，很快就发现，投入的时间越长，薪水就越丰厚。谁又能责怪我们认为训练也应该如此呢？**

Well, stop thinking it right now, because it's wrong, wrong, wrong. The cold fact is, no matter how long or hard you train, without proper recovery you will never optimize your progress. In fact, you may even begin to regress, if you work out so much that you exceed your recovery capacity.
好吧，现在就别再想了*，因为这完全是错的，错的，错的。残酷的事实是，无论你训练多久、多努力，如果没有适当的恢复，你就永远无法取得最佳进步。事实上，如果你的训练量超过了你的恢复能力，你甚至可能会开始退步。*

The sad thing is, when people see their hard-earned gains slipping away through over-work and under-recovery, what's the first thing they do? They do even more frigging work! They think their problem is that they just weren't training hard enough. I'll say it one more time. You must get rid of the notion that "lack of results = lack of work." In most cases, especially among highly motivated individuals, lack of results = improper work/recovery ratio.
*可悲的是，当人们看到自己辛苦赚来的成果因为过度训练和恢复不足而白白浪费时，他们首先会做什么？他们会更加努力！他们认为自己的问题在于训练不够刻苦*。我再说一遍。*你必须摒弃“缺乏成果=缺乏努力”的观念。在大多数情况下，尤其是在那些积极性很高的人身上，缺乏成果=不合适的训练/恢复比率。*

If you're not making progress, chances are you're not recovering enough.
*如果你没有取得进步，很可能是因为你恢复得还不够。*

The point of this diatribe is to give you a forceful reminder that when designing a program, you should always include enough recovery days to allow your body to adapt, rebuild and improve.
这篇长篇大论的目的是给你一个有力的提醒，在设计一个计划时，**你应该始终留出足够的恢复日，让你的身体适应、重建和改善。**

Understand, however, that "recovery day" is not always just a day off. There are three levels of recovery. Let's look at each.
*不过，要明白“恢复日”并不总是简单的休息日。恢复分为三个阶段。让我们分别来了解一下。*

**Active recovery**

This means performing some physical activity that isn't stressful on the system. **It could be playing a sport, taking a walk, doing some low-intensity cardio or even low-intensity weight training**. This type of recovery can be helpful as it increases blood flow to the muscles and keeps the metabolism running high.

Just resist the temptation to overdo it. Many people are stimulus junkies who turn even a light recovery session into an intense workout! This is especially true if weight training is used as an active recovery tool. Let me repeat myself: **active recovery work must not constitute a stress on the system.**主动恢复训练绝不能给身体系统带来压力。

So when recovering with weights, we're talking high reps (12-20 or even more), not going anywhere near failure. Some people will also make the mistake of performing a high-intensity activity like intervals training of sprints on their recovery days. Intervals, sprints, plyos and such represent a pretty considerable stress on the body, either on the CNS or on the metabolic processes. As a result they do not allow the body to recover optimally from training.
所以，**当我们用力量训练进行恢复时，我们指的是高次数（12-20次甚至更多），而不是接近力竭**。有些人还会犯一个错误，在恢复日进行高强度活动，比如间歇训练或短跑。间歇训练、短跑、增强式训练等等，都会给身体带来相当大的压力，无论是对中枢神经系统还是对代谢过程。因此，它们无法让身体从训练中得到最佳恢复。

Bottom line: any activity that is physically demanding should not be done on an active recovery day.
底线是：任何需要体力的活动都不应该在积极恢复日进行。


Passive recovery

This is your "day off," meaning that you avoid physical activity. But let's not be stupid about this. You're allowed to walk, climb stairs and carry things. You don't have to ride around on one of those little electric carts that fat people use, and if your wife asks you to take out the trash, don't try to dodge it by saying, "But Thibs said no physical activity." A passive recovery day is nothing more or less than a day on which you don't train. And that's all I have to say about that.

Just don't make every day a passive recovery day.


Assisted recovery

This third level involves using methods that enhance the body's capacity to recover from training stress. It may take the form of massages, epsom salt baths, contrast showers, and other such techniques. I suggest that you read 7 Secrets to Rapid recovery for more information.

This type of recovery day is especially useful if for some reason (too much stress, excessive training, improper recovery, etc.) you find yourself starting to accumulate fatigue and have problems recovering from your workouts.

In most cases the following applies:


Active recovery

Use mainly when you are focusing on CNS-based training (heavy weights, explosive movements with relatively low volume); with this type of training the muscles and metabolic processes are not severely taxed but the CNS takes a beating. Low-intensity work (not neurally demanding) can thus be successfully used without fear of over-stressing the metabolic processes. Do not use when undergoing a high-volume phase as the muscles and metabolic processes are already severely taxed.


Passive recovery

These days can be used with all types of training.


Assisted recovery

You may be tempted to use these methods all the time, to become a "recovery machine." However, as with training, the body adapts to recovery methods and if you use them all the time they lose their effectiveness. They are better kept for when your body is under severe stress. They are especially useful when the muscles are under tremendous strain (high volume of relatively intense work).


***Step 10. About special methods\***

**As I said before, training is a highly emotional endeavor.**

In our frenzy to transform ourselves, we want maximum results in minimum time, so when we read about a special training method (e.g. Cluster sets, rest/pause, pre-fatigue supersets, post-fatigue supersets, drop sets, chains, bands, weight releasers, etc.), our first irrational instinct is to throw them right into our training programs, expecting them to work miracles for us.
在我们疯狂地改变自己时，我们希望在最短的时间内获得最大的效果，所以当我们读到一种特殊的训练方法（例如，**集群组、休息/暂停、疲劳前超级组、疲劳后超级组、递减组、链条、弹力带、重量释放器等**）时，我们的第一个非理性本能就是将它们直接放入我们的训练计划中，期望它们能为我们创造奇迹。

Yes,these methods will help stimulate more gains. No, they shouldn't be used all the time. Most people actually don't need these methods at all to progress optimally: beginners and most intermediate lifters can maximize their progress simply by focusing on the basics performed with effort and dedication.
是的，这些方法确实有助于刺激肌肉增长。不，它们不应该一直使用。实际上，**大多数人根本不需要**这些方法就能取得*最佳进步*：初学者和*大多数中级举重运动员只需专注于基础训练*，并付出*努力和专注*，就能*最大限度地提高进步*。

It is those more advanced individuals, those for whom every micron of progress seems to take eons to occur, that really need these methods. The more advanced you are, the better adapted your body is to physical stress. As a result, it takes a much bigger physiological stimulus to trigger appreciable gains.
**真正需要这些方法的是那些更先进的人，对他们来说，每一微米的进步似乎都需要漫长的岁月。**你的水平越高，你的身体对身体压力的适应能力就越强。因此，需要更大的生理刺激才能带来显著的进步。

This is where advanced methods really shine. You should include them in your program onlywhen they are needed, to keep your progress going at a satisfactory rate. Using these methods too soon (when you don't really need them) can actually impair your long-term progress.

Fact 1. While advanced individuals need advanced techniques and techniques for optimal growth, beginning and intermediate trainees do not.

Fact 2. The body is very adaptable, and can get used to any training method. Once this happens, the effectiveness of the technique is greatly diminished.
**事实2：身体的适应性很强，可以适应任何训练方法。一旦发生这种情况，该技术的有效性就会大大降低。**

Fact 3. By using your most advanced techniques from the beginning, when you don't need them, you can limit your long term progress by rendering these techniques ineffective when you do need them.

I'm not saying you have to include advanced techniques in your program. Start by learning how to plan the basics. When you're good at that, you can gradually add in more advanced stuff. But do it gradually, first to avoid overloading the system, second to be able to assess the individual effect of each method; if you throw in 3 or 4 advanced methods at a time, it'll be hard to tell for sure which one was responsible for your gains.

***
Conclusion\***

If you have carefully read this entire article, then right now you're probably thinking, "Damn, that was a long article!"

But hopefully you weren't overwhelmed, and are just raring to give this method of program design an honest go. After you've written a few programs "by the numbers," the steps will become second nature for you, and writing new programs will be a breeze.

One caveat, however, before we close. I imagine that one or two of you are just chomping at the bit to look up every training program I (or Chad, or Coach Poliquin, or any of the other Testosterone coaches) have written, and gleefully post in the forums somewhere, "ah-ha!! I found a program that isn't exactly like the one that Thibs' Program Design article recommends!

Well, duh.

This article shows you how to design basic and effective programs. The coaches here at Testosterone tend to present you with slightly more advanced programs, and in order to do that, we sometimes bend the rules a bit.

Realize, though, that in order to bend the rules (without ruining the efficacy of the program), you must first understandthe rules. If you want to write advanced programs, do what we all had to do: put in the time and effort to become really efficient at designing basic programs, then learn to add in more advanced techniques as needed.

In other words, you really need to graduate from high school before thinking about writing your doctoral dissertation. Just take it slowly, progress step by step, and before you know it you'll be designing your own sound, efficient and effective training programs.

And if you post those programs in the Locker Room for my evaluation, the chances are excellent that I will not cringe.

Happy designing!
