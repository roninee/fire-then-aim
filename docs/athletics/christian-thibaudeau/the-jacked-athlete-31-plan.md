####  **Fact 1 事实 1**

If you constantly repeat the same workout week-in and week-out, keeping the same exercises, number of sets, number of reps, and effort and intensity levels, you are pretty much-guaranteeing stagnation (unless you are a genetic phenom or using steroids).
如果您每周都不断地重复相同的锻炼，保持相同的练习、组数、次数以及努力程度和强度，那么您几乎肯定会停滞不前（除非您是遗传天才或使用类固醇）。

####  **Fact 2 事实 2**

There will always be those who strive to achieve a truly massive bodybuilding physique. But what I found to be the most desirable and wanted physique among most people is that of a muscular athlete. A sprinter, a gymnast, a running back or wide receiver, MMA fighter, you name it. Looking muscular and lean but also like to could hold his own in pretty much any type of physical or sporting contest.
总是有人努力追求真正健美的体格。但我发现，**大多数人最渴望拥有的体格是肌肉发达的运动员。短跑运动员、体操运动员、跑卫或外接手、综合格斗选手**，等等。他们不仅看起来肌肉发达、精瘦，而且几乎可以在任何类型的体能或体育比赛中保持优势。

And it's not just about the look either: most want to look good but also be able to perform at least equally as well. We don't want the body of a Ferrari with the engine of a Honda Civic!
而且这不仅仅是外观的问题：*大多数人不仅希望外观漂亮，而且性能至少也要同样出色*。我们可不想拥有法拉利的车身和本田思域的引擎！

Those two facts have pretty much been the cornerstone of my personal training career and have shaped how I train clients. I like to blend in various training styles and even training objectives. And although it can seem counterintuitive to spend less time on one specific goal, you can actually reach that goal sooner by changing things around more frequently than you might think.
*这两个事实几乎是我私人教练生涯的基石*，也塑造了我训练客户的方式。我喜欢融合各种训练风格，甚至训练目标。虽然花更少的时间在一个特定的目标上似乎有悖常理，但实际上，通过比你想象的更频繁地调整训练内容，你可以更快地实现这个目标。

With that in mind, I developed an elegant approach that allows one to get all of that: strength, explosiveness, muscle mass, and conditioning.
考虑到这一点，我开发了一种优雅的方法，可以让人获得所有这些：*力量、爆发力、肌肉质量和身体状况。*

####  **The Basis Principle 基本原则**

The approach is simple but the reasons why it works are much more complex (I'll get to them later); basically, you use a performance-based plan for 3 weeks, and then you do 1 week of hypertrophy work.
这种方法很简单，但其有效的原因却要复杂得多（我稍后会讲到）；基本上，*你使用基于绩效的计划 3 周，然后进行 1 周的肥大训练。*
