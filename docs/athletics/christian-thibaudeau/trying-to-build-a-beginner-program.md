My recommendation if you are that “skinny” and “can't move much weight” would be to pick three main movements and train them 3-4 days a week (e.g. deadlift, bench press, front squat) and to that add 1 main assistance movement per day and 1 isolation exercise. The main movements are done for 3 sets of 3, then 3 sets of 6. The assistance lifts for 4 x 6 and the isolation movement for 3 x 8-12. For example:
如果你“太瘦”且“举不起大重量”，我的建议是选择三个主要动作，每周训练3-4天（例如硬拉、卧推、前蹲），并在此基础上每天增加一个主要的辅助动作和一个隔离动作。主要动作做3组，每组3个，然后做3组，每组6个。辅助动作做4组，每组6个，隔离动作做3组，每组8-12个。例如：

*一共每天是 13组*

Honestly I think you're trying to do too much. If you get a big squat, Deadlift, bench, overhead press (push press), SGHP, or clean, do some chins, activate your nervous system with jumps (box jumps, weighted squat jumps), or throws (MB or explosive push-ups), do some loaded carries or sled pushes or pulls, then get out of the gym & eat…you will be jacked …form, technique, stimulate (if your performance is improving you have the right dose, if it's not get an extra helping of rest, recovery, & eat more), if you're in the middle of your workout & your performance drops you're done for the day…that's just my take on it [/quote]
说实话，我觉得你练得太多了。如果你能做个大重量深蹲、硬拉、卧推、过顶推举（推举）、SGHP（俯卧撑）或者挺举，做些引体向上，用跳跃（跳箱、负重深蹲跳）或者投掷（MB 或爆发式俯卧撑）来激活你的神经系统，做些负重负重搬运或者雪橇推拉，然后离开健身房吃点东西……你就会感觉很棒……动作、技巧、刺激（如果你的表现有所提高，说明你用对了剂量；如果没有提高，就多休息、多恢复，多吃点东西），*如果你在训练中途表现下降，那你今天的训练就结束了*……这只是我的看法。[/quote]

Thanks, I definitely appreciate the input. But, a little confused; what I posted above is basically what you're proposing, no? Big movement, followed with some assistance (chins/dips), then carries. Only addition would be forearms/calves stuff at the end.
谢谢，非常感谢你的意见。不过，我有点困惑；我上面说的基本上就是你建议的，对吧？大幅度运动，然后辅助（引体向上/双杠臂屈伸），然后是搬运。最后只需要增加前臂/小腿的训练。

Perhaps I'm just not currently working hard enough, but I'd like to think that I'm going pretty damn hard/heavy, and with short rest intervals, and still don't get tired. That's the main reason that I'm looking for more of a focused volume-based attack than 531. Even working with at-or-beyond training maxes for heavy singles-triples, and working in drop sets of 10, I'm not getting fatigued with my current approach.
也许我现在训练强度还不够，但我认为我已经达到了相当高强度/大重量的训练强度，并且休息时间很短，但仍然不会感到疲劳。这就是为什么我更倾向于专注于训练量而不是531磅的主要原因。即使我使用达到或超过最大训练强度的单组/三组大重量训练，以及10组递减组的方式进行训练，我目前的方法也不会感到疲劳。

Maybe I just need to try harder? Or maybe I've got better genes than I thought? I dunno, all I know is that right now, I still don't feel “worked” until the volume well surpasses “normal”. So I figured that sticking to ONE big lift/movement pattern per day, and beating the snot out of it may help to fry the fibers better. That, coupled with more frequent (but shorter) workouts sounds more like what I respond well to. On paper, anyway.
也许我只是需要更努力？又或许我的基因比我想象的要好？我不知道，我只知道现在，除非训练量远远超过“正常水平”，否则我感觉不到“锻炼”了。所以我觉得，每天坚持一个大重量的举重/运动模式，并全力以赴，或许能更好地锻炼肌肉纤维。再加上更频繁（但更短）的训练，听起来我感觉更适合。至少理论上是这样。

But yes, I will definitely be upping both carbs and total calories well past what I am comfortable with. [/quote]
但是是的，我肯定会增加碳水化合物和总卡路里的摄入量，远远超过我可以接受的水平。[/quote]

1. Fatigue has nothing to do with gains, drop that mentality right now. The only measure of progress is progress itself!!! The goal of STRENGTH TRAINING is to build strength (and power), NOT to burn energy or make you suffer. If you are able to consistently add weight to the bar you are likely doing something right. If anything you should leave the gym more energetic that when you came in.
   *疲劳与进步无关，现在就放下这种心态。衡量进步的唯一标准就是进步本身*！！！力量训练的目标是增强力量（和爆发力），而*不是消耗能量或让你痛苦*。如果你能持续增加重量，那么你很可能做对了。*你应该比刚进健身房时更有活力，离开健身房。*
2. Forearms work is a waste of time and energy if you are (a) deadlifting without straps and (b) doing carries such as farmer's walk (without straps) (c) doing chin-ups … always invest where your training money will have the greatest return and unless your grip strength is holding you back and need to be strengthened, forearm work is never a good investment. And if you DO need to improve grip strength, forearm work is not the answer, grip work is (pinch grip deadlift, thick bar holds, pull-up hanging, etc.)
   如果你（a）不借助护具进行硬拉，以及（b）进行类似**农夫行走（不借助护具）的负重行走**，以及（c）进行引体向上，那么*前臂训练就是在浪费时间和精力*…… 一定要把训练资金投入到能带来最大回报的地方，除非你的握力阻碍了你的发展，需要进一步加强，否则*前臂训练永远不是一项好的投资。如果你确实需要提升握力，前臂训练并非最佳答案，握力训练才是（夹握硬拉、粗杆支撑、引体向上悬垂等等）。*
3. Calves work is not necessary if you do big compound movements like deadlifts, squats, power cleans, high pulls and do weighted carries. Nothing will build the calves like loaded carries and prowler pushing.
   如果你进行硬拉、深蹲、力量翻、高拉和负重负重等大型复合动作，小腿训练就没有必要了。没有什么比负重负重和推举训练更能锻炼小腿了。

##  [Trying to Build a Beginner Program

尝试构建一个初学者程序](https://t-nation.com/t/trying-to-build-a-beginner-program/222049)

Christian_Thibaudeau 回答一个计划

That actually looks like a fairly advanced program. More than that, it;s one of the worst programs I've seen.
**这看起来确实是一个相当先进的程序。更糟糕的是，它是我见过的最糟糕的程序之一。**

- You do not understand the inverse relationship between *volume and frequency*. If you are a natural trainee (not using performance-enhancing drugs) you can use a high volume OR a high frequency, not both. I personally believe in frequency over volume. But Doing 6 sets per exercises, on 6 exercises per session is WAAAAYYYYYY too much. Honestly I have very good work capacity and love to train. But there is NO WAY I can do all the work you wrote into the program and have a good quality to my sessions, let alone do it 6x a week. I would say that you have AT LEAST twice the volume you should be doing.
  你不明白**训练量和频率之间**的*反比*关系。如果你是*自然训练者（不使用任何兴奋剂）*，你可以选择高训练量或高频率，但*不能两者兼顾*。我*个人认为频率重于训练量*。但是，**每组动作6个动作，每节课6个动作，这实在是太过分了**。说实话，我的训练能力很强，也热爱训练。但**我绝对不可能完成你计划里写的所有训练量**，而且还能保持*高质量*的训练，更不用说*每周6次*了。我想说，**你的训练量至少是正常训练量的两倍。**
- If you need 6 sets per exercises it is likely that you are not training hard enough on the sets you are doing. 3 sets per exercises is better than 2 which is better than 1. But 4 only offer marginal benefits and ONLY in certain circumstances and past that there are no benefits in doing more sets when it comes to stimulating muscle growth (building strength via neural improvements is another thing).
  如果您每个练习需要 6 组，那么很可能您在进行的练习组中训练得不够刻苦。*每个练习 3 组比 2 组好，2 组又比 1 组好。但是 4 组只能提供边际效益，并且仅在某些情况下才有效*，而且在刺激肌肉生长方面，做更多组并没有任何好处（通过神经改善来增强力量是另一回事）。
- You seem to have a focus on the amount of work you are doing (evidenced by the fact that you are using both a very high volume per session and a very high frequency). That is the wrong focus. The only thing that matters is progress and it will be impossible to progress past a few weeks with this program.
  你似乎太注重训练量了（从你每次训练的训练量和频率都很高就可以看出）。这完全是错误的。*唯一重要的是进步，而这个计划几周后就不可能再有进步了。*

Here are somethings I wrote that might interest you…
以下是我写的一些内容，您可能会感兴趣……

"Ok here's something I've gotta say.
“好吧，我有件事要说。
I believe that a lot of you are killing their gains because they pride in the wrong things when it comes to training.
我相信你们中的很多人因为在训练时骄傲于错误的事情而失去了他们的进步。

The ONLY thing that matters is how much progress you are making. That … is … all … that … matters. PERIOD.
唯一重要的是你取得了多少进步。这才是最重要的。就是这样。

I see a lot of people taking more pride in how much work they do than how much results they are getting. Listen: it doesn't matter if you trained 7 days this week or 3. It doesn't matter if you did 30 sets in your workout or 10. **The only thing on which a program should be judged is how much progress you are making.**
我看到很多人更看重自己付出的努力，而不是取得的成果。听着：你这周训练了7天还是3天，这都无关紧要。你做了30组还是10组，这都无关紧要。评判一个训练计划的唯一标准是你取得了多少*进步*。

The work you are doing in the gym is done for one reason: to stimulate changes in your body. The goal is the changes, the work is only what you are doing to achieve the goal.
你在健身房里所做的训练*只有一个目的：刺激身体的变化。目标是变化，而训练只是你为了达到目标而采取的行动。*

In real life would you brag about working 60 hours a week but only making 500$ that week?
在现实生活中，你会吹嘘每周工作 60 小时但那一周只赚 500 美元吗？
Listen, being a hard worker is important. Unless you are a genetic freak hard work will be required to get maximum results. But understand that it is not an end in itself.
听着，*努力工作很重要*。除非你是基因突变，否则努力工作才能取得最大的成果。*但要明白，努力本身并非目的。*

The problem is that those who pride themselves first and foremost in the amount of work they are doing, are often killing their gains because the amount they are doing exceeds the amount of work they can handle and have a positive adaptation from.
问题在于，*那些首先为自己所做的工作量感到自豪的人，往往会扼杀自己的成果，因为他们所做的工作量超出了他们能够处理和积极适应的范围。*

Because of biochemical factors that are outside the scope of this post, it is completely possible to regress because you are doing too much work (lose muscle and strength).
*由于超出本文讨论范围的生化因素，完全有可能因为工作量过大而出现退步（失去肌肉和力量）。*

Take powerlifting for example. I know a lot of people who took the Westside Barbell system and decided that it wasn't enough work soi they added more exercises and sets in each session. Listen why would you believe that YOU can tolerate more physical work than someone who is (1) likely genetically built to handle hard physical work (2) has years, sometimes decades of experience with high level strength lifting (3) might be using drugs.
以力量举为例。我认识很多人练习过 Westside Barbell 系统，但觉得训练量不够，所以每次训练都增加了动作和组数。你听着，你凭什么相信自己比那些（1）天生就适合高强度体力训练的人（2）拥有多年甚至数十年高强度力量举训练经验的人（3）可能服用过药物的人更能承受高强度的体力训练？

If the Westside split is 4 hard days a week why could you handle 5 or 6? If they can handle 1 maximum and 1 heavy assistance lift per session why could you handle 2 or each?
*如果西区每周只有4天的高强度训练，为什么你们能安排5天或6天呢？如果他们每次最多能安排1次高强度训练，并且每次都能安排1次重型辅助训练，为什么你们能安排2次或每次都安排呢？*
And that is just one example. When you look at the top strength athletes for advice if your first reaction is 'are you sure that's enough?" you might have a problem."
这只是一个例子。当你向顶级力量型运动员寻求建议时，如果你的第一反应是“你确定这够了吗？”，那么你可能有问题。

"SURROGATE GOALS AND TRAINING
*“替代目标和培训*
This is a continuation of yesterday's post about getting results being the only important thing with training.
这是昨天关于获得结果是训练唯一重要的事情的帖子的延续。

One of the basic needs of a human being is “esteem”: Feeling like you are achieving something and getting the respect of others.
*人类的基本需求之一是“尊重”：感觉自己有所成就并得到他人的尊重。*

People who are achieving either important things or accomplishing something worth respect have this fairly easily. But those who aren't doing anything special need to crate surrogate goals for themselves.
那些取得了重大成就或值得尊敬的人很容易做到这一点。*但那些没有做任何特别事情的人需要为自己设定替代目标。*

This is true in life and in training.
*在生活中和训练中都是如此。*

A typical example is somebody who is a militant/manifestant for a cause that doesn't affect him personally. For example an heterosexual, middle class male who is actively participating in feminist manifestations.
一个典型的例子是，某人为了某个与他个人无关的事业而积极行动/声援。例如，一位积极参与女权主义示威活动的异性恋中产阶级男性。

If you are a woman and you feel that you are oppressed or treated unfairly because of your sex I understand why you would want to protest publicly. I do not agree with the modern feminist views (I feel that our society is pretty balanced, in fact men are often treated unfairly themselves) but I understand why some females would feel strongly about that cause.
如果你是女性，并且觉得自己因为性别而受到压迫或不公平对待，我理解你想公开抗议的原因。我不认同现代女权主义的观点（我觉得我们的社会相当平衡，事实上男性自己也经常受到不公平的对待），但我理解为什么一些女性会强烈反对这一事业。

But why would a middle class, average male take this cause at heart? He might make you believe that he is fighting for the rights of women. But the truth is completely different.
但一个中产阶级的普通男性怎么会把这件事放在心上呢？他或许会让你相信他是在为女性权利而战。但事实却截然不同。

The reality is that this cause is a surrogate goal: something that the person latches on to be able to earn the respect of others. In this case the person is subconsciously looking for the respect and approval of women.
事实上，这种事业其实是一种替代目标：一个人为了赢得他人的尊重而依附于某种东西。在这种情况下，这个人潜意识里是在寻求女性的尊重和认可。

Anyway I don't want to engage on this slippery slope but that is an example of a surrogate goal.
无论如何，我不想参与这种滑坡行为，但这是一个替代目标的例子。
I see the same thing in training all the time:
**我在训练中经常看到同样的事情：**

- I might not strong but I can do more work than everybody else. That person uses the amount of work being done to get a sense of accomplishment or the approval/admiration of others.
  *我可能不强大，但我能比别人做得更多*。那种人会利用完成的工作量来获得成就感，或者获得他人的认可/钦佩。
- I'm not gaining a lot of muscle mass but I can do crazy exercises like one-leg overhead squats on a Swiss ball, let's see those muscle monsters do that! Again using a surrogate way to feel good about yourself and feel like others are respecting you.
  *我的肌肉量没怎么增长，但我能做一些疯狂的训练*，比如在健身球上单腿过顶深蹲，让我看看那些肌肉怪兽能做到什么！又一次用一种替代的方式让自己感觉良好，也感受到别人对你尊重。

The problem is that chasing these surrogate goals will take your eyes off of the real purpose of training. Training's purposes are to improve your body's composition (adding muscle, losing fat), capacity to perform (strength, power, agility, speed) and make it healthy (injury prevention, improving health markers). Anything other than that is just an illusion of accomplishment.
问题在于*，追求这些替代目标会让你忽视训练的真正目的*。**训练的目的是改善身体结构（增肌、减脂）、提升运动能力（力量、爆发力、敏捷性、速度），以及增强体质（预防伤病、改善健康指标）**。除此之外的任何事情都只是一种成就感的假象。
If focusing on the illusion prevents you from achieving the true meaning of training, you are wasting your time.
如果专注于幻想会阻碍你实现训练的真正意义，那么你就是在浪费时间。

What will happen is that you will focus so much on the surrogate goals that eventually you will forget why you started training in the first place: to improve your body. And when that happens NOLT getting gains actually becomes acceptable to you as long as you are finding other ways to feel good about yourself.
最终，你会过度关注替代目标，以至于忘记最初开始训练的*初衷：改善体型*。而当这种情况发生时，只要你找到其他让自己感觉良好的方法，NOLT 的增肌效果实际上对你来说就变得可以接受了。

Then you will ridicule those who are actually making significant changes in their body (he doesn't even train hard… yeah he's big but he isn't functional like I am).
然后你会嘲笑那些实际上在身体上做出重大改变的人（他甚至没有刻苦训练......是的，他很大，但他的功能不像我一样）。

This is a dangerous spiral because the more you focus on those artificial validations the less results you will be getting and the more you will forget about actually trying to get results.
这是一个危险的恶性循环，因为你越关注那些人为的验证，你得到的结果就越少，你也会越忘记真正去努力获得结果。

And when that happens you actually stop trying to find ways to solve your lack of progress issue.
当这种情况发生时，您实际上就不再尝试寻找解决缺乏进展问题的方法。
See when you aren't progressing (adding more muscle, getting stronger, getting more powerful, etc.) there is a problem somewhere… your training, nutrition, sleep pattern, etc. might not be adequate. And you need to fix the issue. But if you stop focusing strictly on the results you will also stop trying to find ways to solve your problems.
当你没有进步（增肌、增肌、增强力量等等）时，要意识到某个地方存在问题……你的训练、营养、睡眠习惯等等可能不够。你需要解决这个问题。但如果你不再严格关注结果，你也会停止寻找解决问题的方法。

Once again: the only thing that matters in weight training is getting results. Everything else is just a surrogate goal to make you feel good about yourself when you really shouldn't.
*再说一遍：力量训练中唯一重要的事情就是取得成果。其他一切都不过是让你感觉良好（其实你不应该感觉良好）的替代目标。*

Listen it's OKAY to feel bad about yourself, about your lack of results IF you use that frustration to find a way to solve your problem."
听着，如果你能利用这种挫败感来寻找解决问题的方法，那么对自己、对自己没有取得成果感到难过是可以的。”

"The number one mistake made by natural trainees
“**自然训练者最常犯的错误**
I believe that the work mistake someone training without the help of performance enhancing drugs can make is to do too much volume.
我认为，没有使用兴奋剂进行训练的人所犯的一个错误*就是训练量太大。*

The whole purpose of training to build muscle is to trigger protein synthesis. Once it's been triggered there is no added benefit to continuing punishing a muscle, it will not grow more. In fact, it will grow less and might even lose size!
增肌训练的全部目的就是触发蛋白质合成。一旦触发，继续惩罚肌肉就没有任何好处，它不会再生长。事实上，它生长得更少，甚至可能缩小！

The key to growth is having the biggest difference between protein synthesis (building muscle) and protein breakdown (mobilizing amino acids from muscles for energy). The more volume you do, the more protein breakdown you get. Why? Because the more volume you do the more glycogen you need to burn for fuel.
增肌的关键在于，蛋白质合成（肌肉生长）和蛋白质分解（从肌肉中调动氨基酸获取能量）之间的最大差异。训练量越大，蛋白质分解越多。为什么？因为训练量越大，需要燃烧的糖原就越多。

What does this have to do about protein breakdown? Plenty!
这和蛋白质分解有什么关系？有很多关系！

When you have to mobilize stored glycogen you need to increase the release of cortisol. Basically during training cortisol's role is to mobilize energy to be used for fuel.
当你需要调动储存的糖原时，你需要增加皮质醇的释放。基本上，在训练过程中，皮质醇的作用是调动能量，为身体提供能量。

The more fuel you need, the greater the cortisol release.
你需要的燃料越多，皮质醇释放就越多。

So the more volume you do, the more glycogen you need to burn, the greater the cortisol release.
因此，你的运动量越大，你需要燃烧的糖原就越多，皮质醇释放就越多。

And cortisol also comes with a drawback: it can hurt muscle growth. It does so 3 ways:
皮质醇也有一个缺点：它会阻碍肌肉生长。它通过三种方式阻碍肌肉生长：

1. By increasing the breakdown of amino acids from muscles… basically cortisol breaks down muscle tissue to turn it into fuel. That's why we say that cortisol is a catabolic hormone.
   通过增加肌肉中氨基酸的分解……基本上，皮质醇会分解肌肉组织，将其转化为能量。这就是为什么我们说皮质醇是一种分解代谢激素。
2. By inhibiting mTor. MTor is the light switch that turns on protein synthesis (muscle building). Cortisol can inhibit mTor directly and my increasing the level of AMPK. So the more cortisol you produce, the more likely you are to negate the effect of training on protein synthesis. Basically mTor will turn on muscle-building, cortisol can turn it off
   通过抑制 mTor。mTor 是开启蛋白质合成（肌肉生成）的开关。皮质醇可以直接抑制 mTor，从而提高 AMPK 的水平。因此，你分泌的皮质醇越多，你就越有可能抵消训练对蛋白质合成的影响。基本上，mTor 会开启肌肉生成，而皮质醇会关闭它。
3. Cortisol and other glucocorticoids increase the expression of the myostatin gene. Myostatin expression limits the amount of muscle you build. The more myostatin expression you have, the less muscle you build. High cortisol levels, and thus a high volume of work, lead to a greater myostatin expression during the recovery period after a workout.
   皮质醇和其他糖皮质激素会增加肌生长抑制素基因的表达。肌生长抑制素的表达会限制肌肉的生成量。肌生长抑制素表达越多，肌肉生成量就越少。皮质醇水平高，因此运动量大，会导致运动后恢复期肌生长抑制素表达增高。

So what we want is to trigger mTor/protein synthesis but also keep cortisol release as low as possible to maximize the growth stimulus. This means that volume must be kept low.
因此，我们的目标是触发 mTor/蛋白质的合成，同时尽可能降低皮质醇的释放，以最大限度地刺激生长。这意味着必须保持较低的释放量。

It also means that since you can't afford to do a lot of volume you have to make sure that the volume you do is done at an intensity level that will trigger mTor activation.
这也意味着，由于您无法承担大量的训练量，因此您必须确保训练量达到能够触发 mTor 激活的强度水平。

Note that enhanced (drug-using) bodybuilders do not have that same problem.
请注意，增强型（使用药物）健美运动员不会遇到同样的问题。

Enhanced bodybuilder do not need to stimulate protein synthesis with the session: the anabolic hormones they are taking artificially increase protein synthesis 24/7. As such doing too much volume will not have the same negative impact as for a natural trainee."
强化型健美运动员无需通过训练来刺激蛋白质合成：他们服用的合成代谢激素会全天候人为地增加蛋白质合成。因此，训练量过大不会像自然训练那样带来负面影响。



> I think I read somewhere it would be best to train the movement 2-3 times a week. But somehow I thought I needed more volume for more “practice”. What is a good frequency/volume ratio for training for form
> 我好像在哪儿读到过，每周最好训练这个动作2-3次。但不知怎么的，我觉得我需要更大的训练量才能“练习”得更多。对于形体训练来说，合适的频率/训练量比例是多少？

You are right… frequency is the most important variable in motor learning NOT volume/amount of practice.
你是对的......**频率是运动学习中最重要的变量，而不是练习的量/数量。**

3-4 work set per exercises with ONE of these being a really hard set. Hitting the big basic lifts 2-3 times per week each (ideally 3) . Daily I suggest 2 big lifts and 2 assistance movements, or 3 big lifts and 1 assistance move.
*每个动作3-4个训练组*，其中一组是难度极高的训练组。每周进行2-3次（最好是3次）大型基础动作。我建议*每天进行2次大型动作和2次辅助动作，或者3次大型动作和1次辅助动作*。

---

Really hard doesn't mean sets of 3 reps with 90%. Really hard means pushing to the limit on a set, regardless of what weight you are using. I would not use percentages if you are a beginner and I would not use less than 5 reps per set.
真正努力并不意味着每组3次，每次的重量都达到90%。真正努力意味着在每组中挑战极限，无论你使用多少重量。如果你是*初学者*，我*不会使用百分比*，而且我也*不会让你每组少于5次*。

If you do 3 sets of 5 it would mean 2 more conservative sets, where you might have 2 reps left in the tank and a third set where you go a bit heavier and go until you can't do another good rep… on some sets you might get 6 or even 7 reps on some you might get only 4 (although you should shoot for at least 5).
*如果您做 3 组，每组 5 次，这意味着有 2 组比较保守，其中您可能还剩下 2 次重复，而第三组您会举起更重一点的重量，直到您无法再做一次好的重复为止... 在某些组中，您可能会得到 6 次甚至 7 次重复，而在某些组中，您可能只得到 4 次（尽管您应该至少争取 5 次）。*
