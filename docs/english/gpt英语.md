现在，我要你改写以下段落，你可以60%基于以下段落的原文再进行改写，改写的要求如下，按重要性排序。

1. 我希望绝大部分句子是简单句，但是最好每一句都有非谓语动词
2. 把内容改成简单句，每个段落40-60个单词，每个段落不超过两个复合句，复合句最好是定语从句或名词性从句
3. 你不必按照以下内容分段，只要求改写后的内容是不超出下面讲述的范围就可以
4. 每个段落最后一句是：我(读者)表达感受的句子，例如 I feel, i am happy/sad/excited to
5. 先写5——7个段落，同时每一段后面要有中文翻译

Harry Potter lived in a private cupboard under the stairs, which was empty except for a small bed. The Dursleys, his relatives, treated him badly. They doubted he had any ability, and saying, "You're nobody special!" Harry, whose life was full of pain, wished he could discover a better place. If he were free, he would explore the world. One day, a letter arrived, addressed to him. "Who would send me mail?" he wondered. The Dursleys, who managed the house, hid it. This was the beginning of a mystery that would change everything.

Letters for Harry were sent in plenty, filling the Dursley house. Uncle Vernon, who was a strict manager, was furious. "Nobody shall know about this!" he shouted. The letters, which came through the gate, were never opened. Harry had no doubt they were important. If he could read them, he might find his purpose. The Dursleys tried to prevent this, pulling the letters away. But the letters increased, spreading like magic. Harry, active and curious, felt a sense of relief. "I'm not alone," he thought, as the public mystery grew.

One night, a giant named Hagrid knocked at the door. "Harry, you're a wizard!" he announced. Harry, whose eyes were wide, had no doubt now. Hagrid explained that Hogwarts, a school for magic, required Harry's presence. If Harry joined, he would learn spells. The Dursleys, who lived a private life, were shocked. "This is nonsense!" they cried. But Hagrid, a gentle giant, pulled Harry toward a new direction. The community of wizards was waiting. Harry's heart raced—he was finally valued. A magical world was about to be discovered.

Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley, with a magical market. Shops sold wands, books, and metal cauldrons. Harry, who had never seen such a place, was excited. "What shall I buy?" he asked. Hagrid suggested a wand, saying, "It's the most important tool." Customers moved in every direction, and the community was active. If Harry had stayed with the Dursleys, he would have missed this. A shop's material was displayed publicly, unlike the Dursleys' private world. Harry felt free, ready to receive his wand and begin his journey.

In Ollivander's shop, wands were tested. Harry tried many, but none worked. "Don't doubt your ability," Ollivander, who was a wise gentleman. Finally, a wand produced a bright light. "This wand has chosen you," he announced. Harry felt a sense of relief. If he hadn't come, he would never know his power. The wand, made of special material, was unique. Unlike the public market outside, this moment was private, just for Harry. He was told that he'd manage great things. His journey was now clear.

## AI:

- 用I feel 表达读后感或者什么的，有助于提升作文。
- 整个故事用非谓语动词重写，从句，完成时，被动语态
- 发音，多读，语感是辅助。
- 尽量让你编写的故事有趣，有点惊悚（她喜欢惊悚的电影），有趣比包含全部单词更重要，不用包含全部单词，我可能安排多轮小故事学习
- 她非常喜欢哈利波特，所以从改写哈利波特改成简写本开始。她看过很多遍电影，所以里面的专有名词，例如人名，法术名等等都可以保留，不算做生词。

我外甥女15岁，是初中生，还有一个月就是中考了，时间很紧，她愿意每天花半小时学习英语，她不会的单词有可能差不多一千，我不可能让她全部记住那些单词，但是我找了几百个单词，我希望你能用这些单词编改写哈利波特改成简写本开始。她看过很多遍电影，所以里面的专有名词，例如人名，法术名等等都可以保留，不算做生词，你可以先给我写编写10段么。要求：
