*You must be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves.*



- **Be a fox to recognize traps:** A leader must be cunning and intelligent to recognize and avoid the deceptions and tricks of others.
    **要像狐狸一样识破陷阱：** 领导者必须狡猾而聪明，才能识破并避免他人的欺骗和诡计。
- **Be a lion to frighten wolves:** A leader must be strong and intimidating to deter threats and maintain power.
    **要像狮子一样震慑狼群：** 领导者必须强大而令人畏惧，才能震慑威胁并维持权力。
- **Combine both:** Machiavelli argues that a successful ruler cannot rely on just one of these attributes; they must be able to be both a fox and a lion to handle all the challenges they face.
    **将两者结合起来：** 马基雅维利认为，一个成功的统治者不能只依靠其中一种特质；他们必须既像狐狸又像狮子，才能应对他们面临的所有挑战。

Learning from the fox how to recognise traps and from the lion how to frighten off wolves, the prince cannot and must not honour his word when to do so places him at a disadvantage and the reasons for which he made his promise no longer exist.
王子从狐狸身上学会了如何识别陷阱，从狮子身上学会了如何吓走狼群，因此，*当信守诺言会让他处于不利地位，而他当初做出承诺的理由又不复存在时，王子就不能也不应该信守诺言。*

 A prince should have a flexible disposition, varying as fortune and circumstances dictate, not deviating from what is good, if this is possible, but knowing how to do evil, if this is necessary. One judges by the result.
**君主应性灵活，随遇而安**，若有可能则不偏离善行，但**必要**时也应懂得如何**作恶**。评判君主，须以*结果为准*。

 The prince must make himself feared in such a way that, if he is not loved, at least he escapes being hated. Abstain from the property of others, since men sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.
君主必须使自己令人**畏惧**，**即便不被人爱戴，至少也能避免被人憎恨**。他应当避免染指他人的财产，因为**人们更容易忘记父亲的去世，而不是失去家产。**

 Observe the general rule that whoever helps someone else to power ruins himself: he is feared because he knows how to use either ingenuity or force successfully.
记住这条普遍规律：**帮助他人获得权力的人最终会自取灭亡**：他之所以令人畏惧，是因为他懂得如何成功地运用智慧或武力。

 Read history to do what eminent men have in the past done: take as a model some historical figure and always keep his deeds and actions before you.
\* **阅读历史**，效仿过去杰出人物的做法：以某个历史人物为榜样，**时刻铭记他的事迹和行动**。

A prince must show his esteem for talent, actively encouraging able men and honouring those who excel in their profession. No one should be deterred by high taxes from starting a new business.
君主必须展现**对人才的尊重，积极鼓励有能力的人**，并表彰那些在其专业领域取得卓越成就的人。任何人都不应因高税收而放弃创业。

 Never trust a minister who thinks more of himself than of you and always seeks his own profit. Choose wise men for your government and allow only these the freedom to speak the truth, and only on matters about which you ask their opinion, questioning them thoroughly and then making up your own mind.
**永远不要相信那些自以为是**、只顾自身利益的官员。要为政府选择贤能之士，只允许他们在你征求他们意见的事项上畅所欲言，并且要彻底询问他们，然后自己做出决定。

 Recognise that the ruler who adapts his policy to the times prospers, and one whose policy clashes with the demands of the times does not.
要认识到，能够**顺应时代潮流**的统治者会繁荣昌盛，而那些~~政策与时代需求相悖~~的统治者则不会繁荣昌盛。

If a ruler could change his character and so modify his policy according to the time and circumstances, Machiavelli concluded, his good fortune would not change. But there is the rub. Rulers either could not change their character or, having always prospered by proceeding one way, could not persuade themselves to change.
马基雅维利总结道，**如果一位统治者能够改变自己的性格**，从而根据时代和形势调整政策，那么他的**好运**就不会改变。但问题就在这里。统治者要么无法改变自己的性格，要么因为一直以来都靠着一种方式获利，所以无法说服自己改变。

A ruler's own virtù - his prowess, ability, strength of will - accounted for half of what he did and Fortune for the other half. Machiavelli compared Fortune to a violent river, flooding the plain, tearing down trees and buildings, washing soil from one place to deposit it in another. A ruler could take precautions, as he could construct embankments and dykes to make a flood less wild and dangerous. However, Fortuna , being a woman, favoured young men because they commanded her with greater audacity.
统治者自身的德行——即其武艺、能力和意志力——占其成就的一半，而**命运则占另一半**。马基雅维利将命运比作一条狂暴的河流，它淹没平原，摧毁树木和房屋，将泥土从一处冲刷到另一处。统治者可以采取预防措施，例如修建堤坝，以减轻洪水的肆虐和危险。然而，命运女神福尔图娜（Fortuna）是一位女性，她偏爱年轻男子，因为他们更有胆识去驾驭她。
