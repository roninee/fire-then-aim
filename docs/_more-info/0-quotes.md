## 洛克



权力不能私有，财产不能公有，否则人类就进入灾难之门。

**不能交给别人的三项基本权利：生命、财产、自由**

**一个人既然没有创造自己生命的能力，就不能用契约或通过同意把自己交由任何人奴役，或者置身于别人的绝对的、任意的权力之下，任其夺去生命。**

人类从自然状态里走出来进入契约社会，必然把人的一部分权利交给政府，但人的三个基本权利不能交，即生命、财产、自由。

私有财产之所以是神圣的，那是因为有了人的劳动。私有财产之所以是不可侵犯的，是因为侵犯了人类的私有财产，就破坏了人之称为人的基本道德底线。

“就法律的目的不是废除或限制自由，而是保护和扩大自由。哪里没有法律，哪里就没有自由。”

**一个好的社会应该不让任何一个人陷入绝境，更不会逼任何一个人走入绝境。少一个走入绝境的人，社会就多一份安全。**

## 阿克顿 [Lord Acton](https://www.acton.org/research/lord-acton)

[There is not a more perilous or immoral habit of mind than the sanctifying of success.
没有比把成功神圣化更危险或更不道德的思想习惯了。]



[A wise person does at once, what a fool does at last. Both do the same thing; only at different times.
**聪明人立刻做了，傻瓜最后做了**。两者都做同样的事情;只是在不同的时间。]



[Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority: still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority.
权力往往会腐败，绝对权力会绝对腐败。伟人几乎总是坏人，即使他们行使影响力而不是权威：当你通过权威来加重腐败的倾向或确定性时，更是如此。]



[A people averse to the institution of private property is without the first elements of freedom
一个反对私有财产制度的民族没有自由的首要要素]



[Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
**权力往往会腐败，而绝对的权力会绝对腐败。]**



[And remember, where you have a concentration of power in a few hands, all too frequently men with the mentality of gangsters get control. History has proven that.
请记住，当你的权力集中在少数人手中时，具有黑帮心态的男人往往会获得控制权。历史已经证明了这一点。]



[There are two things which cannot be attacked in front: ignorance and narrow-mindedness. They can only be shaken by the simple development of the contrary qualities. They will not bear discussion.
有两件事是不能在前面攻击的：无知和狭隘。他们只能通过相反品质的简单发展来动摇。他们不会接受讨论。]



[The one pervading evil of democracy is the tyranny of the majority, or rather of that party, not always the majority, that succeeds, by force or fraud, in carrying elections.
民主中普遍存在的邪恶是多数人的暴政，或者更确切地说是那个政党的暴政，并不总是多数，它通过武力或欺诈成功地举行了选举。]

## Machiavelli 马基雅维利

The lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves.

**狮子无法保护自己免受陷阱的伤害，狐狸无法抵御狼的攻击。因此，必须像狐狸一样识别陷阱，像狮子一样吓唬狼。** 



**让人爱戴和让人畏惧选择让人畏惧，但是千万不要让别人嫉恨**



Those that have been best able to imitate the fox have succeeded best.
**那些最善于模仿狐狸的人最成功。**



There is no other way to guard yourself against flattery than by making men understand that telling you the truth will not offend you.

防止阿谀奉承的唯一方法，就是让人们明白，告诉你真相不会冒犯你。 



It is much safer to be feared than loved because ...love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.

**被恐惧比被爱更安全**，因为……爱是由义务的纽带维系的，由于人的卑鄙，在每一个有利于他们的机会上都会断裂；但恐惧通过对惩罚的畏惧来保护你，这种畏惧永不失效。

> **“人应当或被慷慨对待或被铲除，因为他们会为轻微伤害报复，重伤则无力反击。”**
>
> 

People should either be caressed or crushed. If you do them minor damage they will get their revenge; but if you cripple them there is nothing they can do. If you need to injure someone, do it in such a way that you do not have to fear their vengeance.

对人要么抚慰，要么粉碎。如果你给他们轻微伤害，他们会报复；但如果你让他们残废，他们就无能为力。如果你需要伤害某人，就要以一种让你不必害怕他们复仇的方式去做。



All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it's impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.

所有行动都有风险，所以谨慎不在于避免危险（这是不可能的），而在于计算风险并果断行动。**犯野心的错误，而不是懒惰的错误。培养做大胆事情的力量，而不是忍受的力量。**



How we live is so different from how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall rather than to his preservation.

**我们如何生活与我们应该如何生活大相径庭，研究应该做什么而不是实际做什么的人，将学会通往毁灭的道路，而不是保存。**



> “人忘恩比忘仇更快。”
>
> **“善良的行为会毁掉你，除非每个人都一样善良。”**



## 大卫·休谟（David Hume）

 

It is not reason which is the guide of life, but custom.

**引导生活的是习俗，而不是理性。**

Custom, then, is the great guide of human life. It is that principle alone which renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past.

**因此，习俗是人类生活的伟大向导。它是唯一一个使我们的经验对我们有用，并使我们期待未来与过去出现的事件相似的原则。**

The mind is carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its usual attendant, and to believe that it will exist.

**心灵在习惯的驱使下，当一个事件出现时，会期待其通常伴随的事物，并相信它会存在。**
