前言已经给我足够力量

### [Introduction: Brave Leaders and Courage Cultures简介：勇敢的领导者和勇气文化] 

I have one deceptively simple and somewhat selfish goal for this book: I desperately want to share everything I’ve learned with you. I want to take my two decades of research and my experiences inside hundreds of organizations to give you a practical, **no-BS,** actionable book about what it takes to be a daring leader.
我对这本书有一个看似简单但有点自私的目标：我迫切地想与你分享我学到的一切。我想利用我二十年的研究和我在数百个组织中的经验，给你一本实用的、 **没有 BS 的、** 可作的书，讲述成为一名大胆的领导者需要什么。

I say “deceptively simple” because the data informing what’s presented in this book are the culmination of:
我说“看似简单”是因为告知本书中介绍的内容的数据是以下方面的高潮：

- Interview data collected over the past twenty years
  过去 20 年收集的访谈数据
- New research including interviews with 150 global C-level (and sea-level) leaders on the future of leadership
  新研究包括对 150 位全球 C 级（和海级）领导者关于领导力未来的采访
- Program evaluation research from our Brave Leaders Inc. courage-building work
  来自 Brave Leaders Inc. 勇气建设工作的项目评估研究
- Data collected during a three-year instrument development study on daring leadership
  在一项为期三年的关于大胆领导力的工具开发研究中收集的数据

Coding and making sense of 400,000 pieces of data is already complex, and the more committed I am to translating the data into actionable, research-based practices, the more painstakingly precise I need to be with the data and the more testing I need to do.
对 400,000 条数据进行编码和理解已经很复杂了，我越是致力于将数据转化为可作的、基于研究的实践，我就越需要对数据进行煞费苦心的精确处理，我需要做的测试就越多。



The selfish part of my goal stems from wanting to be a better leader myself. Over the past five years, I’ve transitioned from research professor to research professor *and* founder and CEO. The first hard and humbling lesson? Regardless of the complexity of the concepts, studying leadership is way easier than leading.
我目标中自私的部分源于我想自己成为更好的领导者。在过去的五年里，我从研究教授转变为研究教授 *、* 创始人兼首席执行官。第一个艰难而谦卑的教训？无论概念多么复杂，学习领导力比领导容易得多。

When I think about my personal experiences with leading over the past few years, the only endeavors that have required the same level of self-awareness and equally high-level “comms plans” are being married for twenty-four years and parenting. And that’s saying something. I completely underestimated the pull on my emotional bandwidth, the sheer determination it takes to stay calm under pressure, and the weight of continuous problem solving and decision making. Oh, yeah—and the sleepless nights.
当我回想过去几年的个人领导经历时，唯一需要相同水平的自我意识和同样高水平的“沟通计划”的努力是结婚 24 年和养育子女。这说明了一些事情。我完全低估了我的情感带宽的牵引力，在压力下保持冷静所需的纯粹决心，以及持续解决问题和决策的重量。哦，是的——还有那些不眠之夜。

My other quasi-selfish goal is this: I want to live in a world with braver, bolder leaders, and I want to be able to pass that kind of world on to my children. **I define a leader as anyone who takes responsibility for finding the potential in people and processes, and who has the courage to develop that potential.** From corporations, nonprofits, and public sector organizations to governments, activist groups, schools, and faith communities, we desperately need more leaders who are committed to courageous, wholehearted leadership and who are self-aware enough to lead from their hearts, rather than unevolved leaders who lead from hurt and fear.
我的另一个近乎自私的目标是：我想生活在一个拥有更勇敢、更大胆的领导者的世界，我希望能够将这样的世界传递给我的孩子们。 **我将领导者定义为任何有责任在人员和流程中发现潜力，并有勇气开发这种潜力的人。** 从公司、非营利组织和公共部门组织到政府、活动团体、学校和信仰团体，我们迫切需要更多致力于勇敢、全心全意领导的领导者，他们有足够的自我意识，能够发自内心地领导，而不是在受伤和恐惧中领导的未进化的领导者。

We’ve got a lot of ground to cover, and I told Steve that I wanted to write a book that would change how the reader thinks about leading, would result in at least one meaningful behavior change, and could be read cover to cover on one flight. He laughed and asked, “Houston to Singapore?”
我们有很多领域要涵盖，我告诉 Steve，我想写一本书，改变读者对领导的看法，至少带来一个有意义的行为改变，并且可以在一次航班上从头到尾阅读。他笑着问道：“休斯顿到新加坡？



He knows that’s the longest flight I’ve ever endured (Moscow was just halfway). I smiled and said, “No. New York to L.A. With a short delay.”
他知道这是我经历过的最长的飞行（莫斯科只是半途）。我微笑着说：“不。纽约到洛杉矶短暂的延误。

#### Brave Leaders and Courage Cultures 勇敢的领导者和勇气文化

I’ve always been told, “Write what you need to read.” What I need as a leader, and what every leader I’ve worked with over the past several years has asked for, is a practical playbook for putting the lessons from *Daring Greatly* and *Rising Strong* into action. There are even a few learnings from *Braving the Wilderness* that can help us create a culture of belonging at work. If you’ve read these books, expect some familiar lessons with new context, stories, tools, and examples related to our work lives. If you haven’t read these books—no problem. I’ll cover everything you need to know.
我总是被告知，“写你需要读的东西。作为一名领导者，我需要的，也是过去几年与我共事的每一位领导者所要求的，是一本实用的手册，可以将 *Daring Greatly* 和 *Rising Strong* 的经验教训付诸行动。甚至还有一些从*勇敢的荒*野中学到的东西可以帮助我们在工作中创造一种归属感文化。如果您读过这些书，期待一些熟悉的课程，其中包含与我们的工作生活相关的新背景、故事、工具和示例。如果您还没有读过这些书——没问题。我将涵盖您需要了解的所有内容。

The language, tools, and skills described in these chapters require courage and serious practice. Yet they are straightforward and, I believe, accessible and actionable to everyone holding this book. The barriers and obstacles to daring leadership are real and sometimes fierce. But what I’ve learned from both the research and my own life is that as long as we name them, stay curious, and keep showing up, they don’t have the power to stop us from being brave.
这些章节中描述的语言、工具和技能需要勇气和认真的练习。然而，它们是直截了当的，我相信，每个拿着这本书的人都可以理解和作。大胆领导的障碍和障碍是真实的，有时是激烈的。但我从研究和我自己的生活中学到的是，只要我们说出他们的名字，保持好奇心，不断出现，他们就没有力量阻止我们勇敢。

We’ve built a *Dare to Lead* hub on [brenebrown.com](http://brenebrown.com) where you can find resources including a free downloadable workbook for anyone who wants to put this book further into action as you read. I highly recommend it. As we learned from the research we did for *Rising Strong*: **We know that the way to move information from your head to your heart is through your hands.**
我们在 brenebrown.com 上建立了一个 *Dare to Lead* 中心 [，](http://brenebrown.com) 您可以在其中找到资源，包括可免费下载的工作簿，供任何想在阅读时将本书进一步付诸实践的人使用。我强烈推荐它。正如我们从为 *Rising Strong* 所做的研究中学到的那样： **我们知道，将信息从您的头脑转移到您的内心的方式是通过您的双手。**



There are also leadership book recommendations and role-play videos that you can watch as part of building your own courage skills. The videos won’t take the place of putting this work into practice, but they will give you some idea of what it can look like, of where it gets hard, and of how to circle back when you inevitably make a mistake.
还有领导力书籍推荐和角色扮演视频，您可以观看这些视频，作为培养自己的勇气技能的一部分。这些视频不会取代将这项工作付诸实践，但它们会让您了解它会是什么样子，哪里会变得困难，以及当您不可避免地犯错时如何回头。

Additionally, you’ll find a downloadable glossary of the language, tools, and skills that I’m discussing in the book. (Terms included in the glossary are bolded throughout the book.)
此外，您还可以找到我在书中讨论的语言、工具和技能的可下载词汇表。（词汇表中包含的术语在整本书中以粗体显示。

#### WHAT STANDS IN THE WAY BECOMES THE WAY 挡路的就是道路

We started our interviews with senior leaders with one question: *What, if anything, about the way people are leading today needs to change in order for leaders to be successful in a complex, rapidly changing environment where we’re faced with seemingly intractable challenges and an insatiable demand for innovation?*
在对高级领导者的采访开始时，我们提出了一个问题： *当今人们的领导方式需要做出哪些改变（如果有的话），才能在复杂、快速变化的环境中取得成功，我们面临着看似棘手的挑战和永不满足的创新需求？*

There was one answer across the interviews: **We need braver leaders and more courageous cultures.**
在采访中，只有一个答案： **我们需要更勇敢的领导者和更勇敢的文化。**

When we followed up to understand the specific “why” behind the call for braver leadership, the research took a critical turn. There wasn’t just one answer. There were close to fifty answers, and many of them weren’t intuitively connected to courage. Leaders talked about everything from critical thinking and the ability to synthesize and analyze information to building trust, rethinking educational systems, inspiring innovation, finding common political ground amid growing polarization, making tough decisions, and the importance of empathy and relationship-building in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
当我们跟进以了解呼吁更勇敢的领导力背后的具体“原因”时，研究发生了关键性转变。答案不止一个。有近 50 个答案，其中许多与勇气没有直观的联系。领导者们谈论了从批判性思维和综合和分析信息的能力到建立信任、重新思考教育系统、激发创新、在日益两极分化中寻找共同政治基础、做出艰难决定，以及在机器学习和人工智能的背景下同理心和建立关系的重要性。

We kept peeling the metaphorical onion by asking: *Can you break down the specific skills that you believe underpin brave leadership?*
我们不断剥开比喻洋葱，问道： *您能否分解一下您认为支撑勇敢领导力的具体技能？*



I was surprised by how much the research participants struggled to answer this question. Just under half of the leaders we interviewed initially talked about courage as a personality trait, not a skill. They typically approached the question about specific skills with a “Well, you either have it or you don’t” answer. We stayed curious and kept pushing for observable behaviors: *What does it look like if you have it?*
我对研究参与者在回答这个问题上付出的辛勤努力感到惊讶。在我们采访的领导者中，只有不到一半的人最初将勇气视为一种人格特质，而不是一种技能。他们通常以“嗯，你要么拥有，要么没有”的答案来回答有关特定技能的问题。我们保持好奇心，并不断推动可观察的行为： *如果你拥有它，它会是什么样子？*

Just over 80 percent of the leaders, including those who believed that courage is behavioral, couldn’t identify the specific skills; however, they could immediately and passionately talk about problematic behaviors and cultural norms that corrode trust and courage. Luckily, the idea of “starting where people are” is a tenet of both grounded theory research and social work, and it’s exactly what I do. As much time as I spend trying to understand *the way,* I spend ten times as much researching *what gets in the way*.
超过 80% 的领导者，包括那些认为勇气是行为的领导者，无法确定具体的技能;然而，他们可以立即热情地谈论腐蚀信任和勇气的问题行为和文化规范。幸运的是，“从人们所在的地方开始”的想法是扎根理论研究和社会工作的信条，这正是我所做的。我花在试图理解*方法*上的时间是十倍，但我花了十倍的时间来研究阻碍*什么* 。

For example, I didn’t set out to study shame; I wanted to understand connection and empathy. But if you don’t understand how shame can unravel connection in a split second, you don’t really get connection. I didn’t set out to study vulnerability; it just happens to be the big barrier to almost everything we want from our lives, especially courage. As Marcus Aurelius taught us, “What stands in the way becomes the way.”
例如，我并没有打算研究羞耻感;我想了解联系和同理心。但是，如果你不明白羞耻感如何在一瞬间瓦解联系，你就不会真正获得联系。我并没有打算研究脆弱性;它恰好是我们想要从生活中得到的几乎所有东西的巨大障碍，尤其是勇气。正如马库斯·奥勒留 （Marcus Aurelius） 教导我们的那样，“挡路的就是道路。

Here are the ten behaviors and cultural issues that leaders identified as getting in our way in organizations across the world:
以下是领导者认为在全球组织中阻碍我们的十种行为和文化问题：

1. We avoid tough conversations, including giving honest, productive feedback. Some leaders attributed this to a lack of courage, others to a lack of skills, and, shockingly, more than half talked about a cultural norm of “nice and polite” that’s leveraged as an excuse to avoid tough conversations. Whatever the reason, there was saturation across the data that the consequence is a lack of clarity, diminishing trust and engagement, and an increase in problematic behavior, including passive-aggressive behavior, talking behind people’s backs, pervasive back-channel communication (or “the meeting after the meeting”), gossip, and the “dirty yes” (when I say yes to your face and then no behind your back).
   我们避免艰难的对话，包括提供诚实、富有成效的反馈。一些领导者将此归因于缺乏勇气，另一些领导者则归因于缺乏技能，令人震惊的是，超过一半的领导者谈到了“友善和礼貌”的文化规范，该规范被用作避免艰难对话的借口。无论出于何种原因，数据都表明，其后果是缺乏明确性，信任和参与度降低，以及问题行为的增加，包括被动攻击行为、背地里说话、无处不在的秘密渠道沟通（或“会后会议”）、八卦和“肮脏的是”（当我当面说“是”，然后在背后说“不”时）。
2. Rather than spending a reasonable amount of time proactively acknowledging and addressing the fears and feelings that show up during change and upheaval, we spend an unreasonable amount of time managing problematic behaviors.
   我们没有花合理的时间主动承认和解决在变化和动荡期间出现的恐惧和感受，而是花费了不合理的时间来管理有问题的行为。
3. Diminishing trust caused by a lack of connection and empathy.
   由于缺乏联系和同理心而导致的信任度降低。
4. Not enough people are taking smart risks or creating and sharing bold ideas to meet changing demands and the insatiable need for innovation. When people are afraid of being put down or ridiculed for trying something and failing, or even for putting forward a radical new idea, the best you can expect is status quo and groupthink.
   没有足够的人敢于冒险或创造和分享大胆的想法来满足不断变化的需求和永不满足的创新需求。当人们害怕因为尝试某事但失败而被贬低或被嘲笑，甚至因为提出一个激进的新想法时，你能期待的最好的就是现状和群体思维。
5. We get stuck and defined by setbacks, disappointments, and failures, so instead of spending resources on clean-up to ensure that consumers, stakeholders, or internal processes are made whole, we are spending too much time and energy reassuring team members who are questioning their contribution and value.
   我们会陷入困境，并被挫折、失望和失败所定义，因此我们没有花费资源进行清理以确保消费者、利益相关者或内部流程得到完整，而是花费了太多时间和精力来安抚那些质疑他们的贡献和价值的团队成员。
6. Too much shame and blame, not enough accountability and learning.
   太多的羞耻和责备，没有足够的责任感和学习。
7. People are opting out of vital conversations about diversity and inclusivity because they fear looking wrong, saying something wrong, or being wrong. Choosing our own comfort over hard conversations is the epitome of privilege, and it corrodes trust and moves us away from meaningful and lasting change.
   人们选择退出关于多样性和包容性的重要对话，因为他们害怕看错、说错话或出错。选择自己的舒适而不是艰难的对话是特权的缩影，它腐蚀了信任，使我们远离有意义和持久的变革。
8. When something goes wrong, individuals and teams are rushing into ineffective or unsustainable solutions rather than staying with problem identification and solving. When we fix the wrong thing for the wrong reason, the same problems continue to surface. It’s costly and demoralizing.
   当出现问题时，个人和团队会急于寻求无效或不可持续的解决方案，而不是坚持发现和解决问题。当我们出于错误的原因修复错误的事情时，同样的问题会继续浮出水面。这代价高昂且令人沮丧。
9. Organizational values are gauzy and assessed in terms of aspirations rather than actual behaviors that can be taught, measured, and evaluated.
   组织价值观是薄纱的，是根据抱负而不是可以教授、衡量和评估的实际行为来评估的。
10. Perfectionism and fear are keeping people from learning and growing.
    完美主义和恐惧阻碍了人们的学习和成长。

I think most of us can look at this list and quickly recognize not only the challenges in our organizations, but our own internal struggles to show up and lead through discomfort. These may be work behaviors and organizational culture concerns, but what underlies all of them are deeply human issues.
我认为我们大多数人都可以查看这份清单，不仅能很快认识到我们组织中的挑战，还能迅速认识到我们自己内部的挣扎，以克服不适。这些可能是工作行为和组织文化问题，但所有这些问题的基础是深刻的人性问题。

After finding the roadblocks, our job was to identify the specific courage-building skill sets that people need to address these problems. We conducted more interviews, developed instruments, and tested them with MBA and EMBA students enrolled at the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University, the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. We worked until we found the answers. Then we tested it, improved it, and tested it again. Let’s unpack what we learned.
找到障碍后，我们的工作是确定人们解决这些问题所需的具体勇气培养技能。我们进行了更多的访谈，开发了工具，并在莱斯大学琼斯商学院、西北大学凯洛格管理学院和宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院就读的 MBA 和 EMBA 学生中对其进行了测试。我们努力工作，直到找到答案。然后我们对其进行测试、改进、再测试。让我们来了解一下我们学到的东西。



#### The Heart of Daring Leadership 大胆领导的核心

##### 1. You can’t get to courage without rumbling with vulnerability. Embrace the suck. 1. 如果不与脆弱作斗争，你就无法获得勇气。拥抱糟糕。

At the heart of daring leadership is a deeply human truth that is rarely acknowledged, especially at work: Courage and fear are not mutually exclusive. Most of us feel brave and afraid at the exact same time. We feel vulnerable. Sometimes all day long. During those “in the arena” moments that Roosevelt described, when we’re pulled between our fear and our call to courage, we need shared language, skills, tools, and daily practices that can support us through the rumble.
大胆领导的核心是一个很少被承认的深刻人性真理，尤其是在工作中：勇气和恐惧并不是相互排斥的。我们大多数人同时感到勇敢和恐惧。我们感到脆弱。有时一整天。在罗斯福描述的那些“在竞技场上”的时刻，当我们在恐惧和勇气的召唤之间被拉扯时，我们需要共享的语言、技能、工具和日常实践，以支持我们度过难关。

The word **rumble** has become more than just a weird *West Side Story* way to say, “Let’s have a real conversation, even if it’s tough.” It’s become a serious intention and a behavioral cue or reminder.
**“隆隆声** ”这个词已经不仅仅是一种奇怪的 *《西区故事* 》说，“让我们进行一次真正的对话，即使这很困难。”它已经成为一个严肃的意图和行为提示或提醒。

**A rumble is a discussion, conversation, or meeting defined by a commitment to lean into vulnerability, to stay curious and generous, to stick with the messy middle of problem identification and solving, to take a break and circle back when necessary, to be fearless in owning our parts, and, as psychologist Harriet Lerner teaches, to listen with the same passion with which we want to be heard.** More than anything else, when someone says, “Let’s rumble,” it cues me to show up with an open heart and mind so we can serve the work and each other, not our egos.
**隆隆声是一种讨论、对话或会议，其定义是致力于面对脆弱性，保持好奇心和慷慨，坚持发现和解决问题的混乱过程，必要时休息一下并绕圈子，无所畏惧地拥有自己的部分，正如心理学家哈丽雅特·勒纳 （Harriet Lerner） 所教导的那样， 以我们希望被倾听的同样热情倾听。** 最重要的是，当有人说“让我们隆隆作响”时，它会提示我以开放的心态和思想出现，这样我们就可以为工作和彼此服务，而不是我们的自我。

Our research led to a very clear, very hopeful finding: Courage is a collection of four skill sets that can be taught, observed, and measured. The four skill sets are:
我们的研究得出了一个非常清晰、非常有希望的发现：勇气是四套可以教授、观察和衡量的技能的集合。这四套技能是：



**Rumbling with Vulnerability
与脆弱性隆隆作响**

**Living into Our Values
践行我们的价值观**

**Braving Trust
勇敢信任**

**Learning to Rise
学习崛起**

The foundational skill of courage-building is the willingness and ability to rumble with vulnerability. Without this core skill, the other three skill sets are impossible to put into practice. Consider this carefully: Our ability to be daring leaders will never be greater than our capacity for vulnerability. Once we start to build vulnerability skills, we can start to develop the other skill sets. The goal of this book is to give you language and specifics on the tools, practices, and behaviors that are critical for building the muscle memory for living these concepts.
建立勇气的基本技能是与脆弱性抗争的意愿和能力。没有这项核心技能，其他三项技能就不可能付诸实践。仔细考虑一下：我们成为大胆领导者的能力永远不会超过我们应对脆弱性的能力。一旦我们开始培养脆弱性技能，我们就可以开始发展其他技能。本书的目标是为您提供有关工具、实践和行为的语言和细节，这些工具、实践和行为对于建立实现这些概念的肌肉记忆至关重要。

We’ve now tested this approach in more than fifty organizations and with approximately ten thousand individuals who are learning these skills on their own or in teams. From the Gates Foundation to Shell, from small family-owned businesses to Fortune 50 companies, to multiple branches of the U.S. military, we have found this process to have significant positive impact, not just on the way leaders show up with their teams, but also on how their teams perform.
我们现在已经在 50 多个组织中测试了这种方法，大约有 1 万人正在自学或团队合作学习这些技能。从盖茨基金会到壳牌，从小型家族企业到财富 50 强公司，再到美国军队的多个部门，我们发现这个过程产生了重大的积极影响，不仅对领导者与团队的互动方式，而且对他们的团队表现方式也产生了积极影响。

###### 2. Self-awareness and self-love matter. Who we are is how we lead. 2. 自我意识和自爱很重要。我们是谁就是我们如何领导。

So often we think of courage as an inherent trait; however, it is less about *who* people are, and more about *how* they behave and show up in difficult situations. Fear is the emotion at the center of that list of problematic behaviors and culture issues—it’s precisely what you’d expect to find as the underlying barrier to courage. However, all of the daring leaders we interviewed talked about experiencing many types of fear on a regular basis, which means that *feeling fear* is not the barrier.
我们经常认为勇气是一种与生俱来的特质;然而，它不在于人们*是谁* ，而更多地是关于他们在困难情况下的行为和表现 *。* 恐惧是问题行为和文化问题清单的核心情绪——它正是你期望发现的勇气的潜在障碍。然而，我们采访的所有大胆的领导者都谈到经常经历多种类型的恐惧，这意味着*感到恐惧*并不是障碍。



The true underlying obstacle to brave leadership is *how we respond* to our fear. The real barrier to daring leadership is our armor—the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that we use to protect ourselves when we aren’t willing and able to rumble with vulnerability. While we’ll learn tools and build skills in the following chapters, we’ll also assess what gets in the way of building courage, especially because we can expect our armor to show up and pose resistance to new ways of doing things and new ways of being. Practicing self-compassion and having patience with ourselves are essential in this process.
勇敢领导的真正潜在障碍是*我们如何应对*我们的恐惧。大胆领导的真正障碍是我们的盔甲——当我们不愿意也无法与脆弱相处时，我们用来保护自己的思想、情感和行为。虽然我们将在以下章节中学习工具和培养技能，但我们也将评估阻碍培养勇气的因素，特别是因为我们可以预期我们的盔甲会出现并对新的做事方式和新的存在方式构成阻力。在这个过程中，练习自我同情和对自己有耐心是必不可少的。

###### 3. Courage is contagious. To scale daring leadership and build courage in teams and organizations, we have to cultivate a culture in which brave work, tough conversations, and whole hearts are the expectation, and armor is not necessary or rewarded. 3. 勇气是会传染的。为了在团队和组织中扩大大胆的领导力并培养勇气，我们必须培养一种文化，在这种文化中，勇敢的工作、艰难的对话和全心全意的期望是期望，盔甲不是必需的，也不是奖励的。

If we want people to fully show up, to bring their whole selves including their unarmored, whole hearts—so that we can innovate, solve problems, and serve people—we have to be vigilant about creating a culture in which people feel safe, seen, heard, and respected.
如果我们希望人们充分出现，带上他们的整个自我，包括他们没有盔甲的全心全意——这样我们就可以创新、解决问题和服务人们——我们必须警惕地创造一种让人们感到安全、被看到、被倾听和被尊重的文化。

**Daring leaders must care for and be connected to the people they lead.
大胆的领导者必须关心他们所领导的人并与之建立联系。**

The data made clear that care and connection are irreducible requirements for wholehearted, productive relationships between leaders and team members. This means that if we do not have a sense of caring toward someone we lead and/or we don’t feel connected to that person, we have two options: Develop the caring and connection or find a leader who’s a better fit. There’s no shame in this—we’ve all experienced the kind of disconnection that doesn’t get better despite our strongest efforts. Understanding that commitment to care and connection is the minimum threshold, we need real courage to recognize when we can’t fully serve the people we lead.
数据清楚地表明，关怀和联系是领导者和团队成员之间全心全意、富有成效的关系的不可简化的要求。这意味着，如果我们对我们领导的人没有关怀感和/或我们感觉与那个人没有联系，我们有两个选择：培养关怀和联系，或者找到更合适的领导者。这并不可耻——我们都经历过那种脱节，尽管我们付出了最大的努力，但这种脱节并没有变得更好。明白对关怀和联系的承诺是最低限度，我们需要真正的勇气来认识到我们何时无法充分为我们所领导的人服务。



Given the reality of the world we live in today, that means leaders—you and I—must create and hold spaces that rise to a higher standard of behavior than what we experience in the news, on TV, and in the streets. And for many, the culture at work may even need to be better than what they experience in their own home. Sometimes leadership strategies make us better partners and parents.
鉴于我们今天生活的世界的现实，这意味着领导者——你和我——必须创造和保持比我们在新闻、电视和街头所体验到的更高行为标准的空间。对许多人来说，工作中的文化甚至可能需要比他们在自己家里体验的更好。有时，领导策略会让我们成为更好的合作伙伴和父母。

As I often tell teachers—some of our most important leaders—we can’t always ask our students to take off the armor at home, or even on their way to school, because their emotional and physical safety may require self-protection. But what we can do, and what we are ethically called to do, is create a space in our schools and classrooms where all students can walk in and, for that day or hour, take off the crushing weight of their armor, hang it on a rack, and open their heart to truly being seen.
正如我经常告诉老师们——我们最重要的一些领导者——我们不能总是要求我们的学生在家里甚至在上学的路上脱下盔甲，因为他们的情感和身体安全可能需要自我保护。但是，我们能做的，也是我们在道德上被要求做的，是在我们的学校和教室里创造一个空间，让所有学生都可以走进来，在那一天或一个小时里，脱下他们沉重的盔甲，把它挂在架子上，敞开心扉，真正被看到。

We must be guardians of a space that allows students to breathe and be curious and explore the world and be who they are without suffocation. They deserve one place where they can rumble with vulnerability and their hearts can exhale. And what I know from the research is that we should never underestimate the benefit to a child of having a place to belong—even one—where they can take off their armor. It can and often does change the trajectory of their life.
我们必须成为一个空间的守护者，让学生能够呼吸、保持好奇心、探索世界，成为他们自己，而不会感到窒息。他们应该有一个地方，在那里他们可以因脆弱而隆隆作响，他们的心可以呼气。我从研究中了解到的是，我们永远不应该低估拥有归属感的地方对孩子的好处——即使是一个可以让他们脱下盔甲的地方。它可以而且经常确实会改变他们的生活轨迹。

If the culture in our school, organization, place of worship, or even family requires armor because of issues like racism, classism, sexism, or any manifestation of fear-based leadership, we can’t expect wholehearted engagement. Likewise, when our organization rewards armoring behaviors like blaming, shaming, cynicism, perfectionism, and emotional stoicism, we can’t expect innovative work. You can’t fully grow and contribute behind armor. It takes a massive amount of energy just to carry it around—sometimes it takes *all* of our energy.
如果我们学校、组织、礼拜场所甚至家庭的文化因为种族主义、阶级主义、性别歧视或任何基于恐惧的领导表现等问题而需要盔甲，我们不能指望全心全意的参与。同样，当我们的组织奖励诸如责备、羞辱、愤世嫉俗、完美主义和情绪坚忍等盔甲行为时，我们不能指望创新工作。你不可能在盔甲后面完全成长和做出贡献。光是携带它就需要大量的能量——有时*它会消耗我们所有的*精力。



The most powerful part of this process for us was seeing a list of behaviors emerge that are not “hardwired.” Everything above is teachable, observable, and measurable, whether you’re fourteen or forty. For the research participants who were initially convinced that courage is determined by genetic destiny, the interview process alone proved to be a catalyst for change.
对我们来说，这个过程最强大的部分是看到一系列非“固定”的行为出现。以上一切都是可教的、可观察的和可衡量的，无论你是 14 岁还是 40 岁。对于最初相信勇气由遗传命运决定的研究参与者来说，仅凭访谈过程就被证明是变革的催化剂。

One leader told me, “I’m in my late fifties and it wasn’t until today that I realized I was taught every single one of these behaviors growing up—by either my parents or my coaches. When I get down to the nitty-gritty, I can almost remember each lesson—how and when I learned it. We could and should be teaching this to everyone.” This conversation was an important reminder to me that time can wear down our memories of tough lessons until what was once a difficult learning fades into “This is just who I am as a person.”
一位领导者告诉我：“我已经五十多岁了，直到今天我才意识到，在我的成长过程中，这些行为中的每一项都是由我的父母或我的教练教给我的。当我深入到细节时，我几乎可以记住每一节课——我是如何以及何时学习的。我们可以而且应该把这个教给每个人。这次谈话提醒了我，时间会磨掉我们对艰难课程的记忆，直到曾经艰难的学习逐渐消失，变成”这就是我作为一个人”。

The skill sets that make up courage are not new; they’ve been aspirational leadership skills for as long as there have been leaders. Yet we haven’t made great progress in developing these skills in leaders, because we don’t dig into the humanity of this work—it’s too messy. It’s much easier to talk about what we want and need than it is to talk about the fears, feelings, and **scarcity** (the belief that there’s not enough) that get in the way of achieving all of it. Basically, and perhaps ironically, we don’t have the courage for real talk about courage. But it’s time. And if you want to call these “soft skills” after you’ve tried putting them into practice—go for it. *I dare you*. Until then, find a home for your armor, and I’ll see you in the arena.
构成勇气的技能并不新鲜;只要有领导者，它们就一直是令人向往的领导技能。然而，我们在培养领导者的这些技能方面还没有取得很大进展，因为我们没有深入研究这项工作的人性——它太混乱了。谈论我们想要什么和需要什么，比谈论阻碍实现这一切的恐惧、感受和**稀缺** （认为不够）要容易得多。基本上，也许具有讽刺意味的是，我们没有勇气真正谈论勇气。但现在是时候了。如果你想在尝试将这些技能付诸实践后称它们为“软技能”——那就去做吧。 *我敢说* 。在那之前，为你的盔甲找到一个家，我会在竞技场上见你。
