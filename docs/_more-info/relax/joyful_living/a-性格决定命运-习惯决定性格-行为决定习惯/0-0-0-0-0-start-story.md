# How to Start a Story: 10 Top Tips From Literary Editors 如何开始一个故事：文学编辑的 10 个重要技巧

The opening lines of a story carry a lot of responsibility. They act as an invitation for someone who’s glanced at the first page of your book to either put it back down or keep reading. 
故事的开头几行承载着很多责任。它们可以邀请那些浏览过你书的第一页的人要么放下它，要么继续阅读。故事的开场白承担着很大的责任。它们就像一个邀请那些看过你书第一页的人要么把它放回去，要么继续阅读。 故事的开头几行承载着很多责任。它们可以邀请那些浏览过你书的第一页的人要么放下它，要么继续阅读。

## 1. Craft an unexpected story opening 1.设计一个意想不到的故事开头

Some of the most memorable opening lines are ones that hook readers with something out of the ordinary. Literary [editor Gareth Watkins](https://reedsy.com/gareth-watkins) often encourages writers to explore this in their own books.
一些最令人难忘的开场白是那些以不同寻常的东西吸引读者的。文学编辑加雷斯·沃特金斯经常鼓励作家在自己的书中探索这一点。

"Think of the opening to *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, or Iain Banks’s, *The Crow Road (It was the day my grandmother exploded*). Of course, your opening doesn’t have to be as outrageous as these but always **aim for the unusual.**
“想想《十九八十四》或​​伊恩·班克斯的《乌鸦路》的开头（那天我祖母爆炸了）。当然，你的开头不必像这些那样令人震惊，但始终要以不同寻常为目标。

"In other words: think of how people will expect the book to start, then take the plot in another direction."
“换句话来说：想想人们会期望这本书如何开始，然后将情节引向另一个方向。”

### Example: *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, George Orwell 示例：十九点八十四分，乔治·奥威尔

![img](images/1984.webp)

Orwell immediately alerts the reader to the fact that we're not in a normal world by deploying a single strange fact at the end of Nineteen Eighty-Four's opening sentence
奥威尔在《十九八十四》的开头句结尾​​处提出了一个奇怪的事实，立即提醒读者我们生活在一个不正常的世界。

*It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
那是四月里一个明亮而寒冷的日子，时钟敲了十三下。*

However, not all books need to start with a twist. Sometimes, all you need is a single strong image.
然而，并不是所有的书都需要以曲折的方式开始。有时，您所需要的只是一个强大的图像。

Tweet "We asked our editors: "how would you start a story?" They came up with 10 insightful ways #amwriting"]
推文“我们问我们的编辑：“你会如何开始一个故事？”他们想出了 10 种富有洞察力的方法#amwriting”]

## 2. Start with a compelling image 2. 从引人注目的图像开始

Many editors will tell you to avoid exposition — the dreaded info dump — at the start of your manuscript. Editor [Harrison Demchick](https://reedsy.com/harrison-demchick?utm_medium=howtostartastory&utm_campaign=seo&utm_source=blog) suggests one of the best ways to avoid this is to begin with an image.
许多编辑会告诉你在手稿的开头避免阐述——可怕的信息转储。编辑 Harrison Demchick 建议避免这种情况的最佳方法之一就是从图像开始。

"By focusing on sensory detail right at the start — sight, sound, taste, touch, smell — and by conveying a particular, defined setting, you can immediately absorb readers within your novel's tangible world.
“通过从一开始就关注感官细节——视觉、声音、味道、触觉、嗅觉——并通过传达特定的、明确的背景，你可以立即将读者吸引到小说的有形世界中。

"Context and background will come later, but a compelling image can be a fantastic hook."
“背景和背景稍后会介绍，但引人注目的图像可以成为绝佳的吸引力。”

### Example: *Fahrenheit 451*, Ray Bradbury 示例：华氏 451 度，雷·布拉德伯里

The image of fire is central to Bradbury's dystopian classic. Appropriately enough, he opens his novel with a maelstrom of images comparing the fire to a snake and a symphony.
火的形象是布拉德伯里这部反乌托邦经典作品的核心。恰如其分的是，他以一系列将火比作蛇和交响乐的图像开始了他的小说。

*It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.
看到东西被吃掉、看到东西变黑、发生变化，真是一种特别的乐趣。他的拳头上握着黄铜喷嘴，这条巨大的巨蟒向世界喷吐剧毒的煤油，血液在他的头上轰鸣，他的双手就像一位了不起的指挥家的手，演奏着所有炽热和燃烧的交响曲，以击垮破烂。和历史的木炭废墟。*

Starting with an image requires a deft hand from the writer. This image must be compelling enough to make the reader continue turning the pages. A simpler alternative may be to throw readers into the middle of the story.
从图像开始需要作者的灵巧之手。该图像必须足够引人注目，以使读者继续翻页。一个更简单的选择可能是将读者带入故事的中心。

## 3. Create interest with immediate action 3.立即行动激发兴趣

Novels that **open \*in medias res\*** (Latin for ["in the midst of action"](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/story-structure/)) are often really effective at immediately grabbing the reader and establishing stakes and tension.
以媒体资源（拉丁语“在行动中”）开头的小说通常能够非常有效地立即吸引读者并建立风险和紧张感。

However, editor [Jeanette Shaw](https://reedsy.com/jeanette-shaw) warns that readers can become untethered without context and a central character. "If you go this route, you must be sure your opening action is compelling enough that the reader is prepared to wait for character setup later."
然而，编辑珍妮特·肖警告说，如果没有背景和中心人物，读者可能会变得不受束缚。 “如果你走这条路，你必须确保你的开场动作足够引人注目，让读者准备好等待稍后的角色设置。”

### Example: Lord of the Flies, William Golding 示例：威廉·戈尔丁《蝇王》

This classic novel starts with a scene of young boys living on a deserted island with no adults in sight. Only later do we learn how they got there in the first place.
这部经典小说以小男孩生活在荒岛上、看不到大人的场景开始。直到后来我们才知道他们最初是如何到达那里的。

*The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead.
金发男孩从最后几英尺的岩石上下来，开始小心翼翼地走向泻湖。尽管他现在已经脱下了学校毛衣，并用一只手拖着它，但他的灰色衬衫粘在身上，头发也贴在额头上。*

## 4. Begin the book with a short sentence  4.以简短的句子开始本书

![img](images/howtostartastory-3.webp)

As Polonius tells young Hamlet, brevity is the soul of wit. But for editor and literary agent [Fran Lebowitz](https://reedsy.com/fran-lebowitz) (who has represented the *Bridgerton* novels amongst other bestsellers), being frugal with your opening sentence can also intrigue a reader and force them to lean in: "Start with something sparse that flicks on our curiosity, above all."
正如波洛尼厄斯告诉年轻的哈姆雷特的那样，简洁是智慧的灵魂。但对于编辑兼文学经纪人弗兰·勒博维茨（Fran Lebowitz）（他代表了布里奇顿小说和其他畅销书）来说，节俭你的开头句也可以吸引读者并迫使他们靠近：“从一些稀疏的东西开始，激发我们的好奇心，上面全部。”

### Example: *The Hobbit*, J.R.R. Tolkien 示例：《霍比特人》、J.R.R.托尔金

For a man who's known for writing lengthy tomes, Tolkien opens up his novel, The Hobbit, with a simple and matter-of-fact sentence that introduces something readers had never encountered before: a hobbit.
对于一个以写长篇巨著而闻名的托尔金来说，他用一句简单而实事求是的句子开始了他的小说《霍比特人》，介绍了读者以前从未遇到过的东西：霍比特人。

*“In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.”
“在地上的一个洞里住着一个霍比特人。”*

But sometimes, a simple question can be just as powerful as a statement.
但有时，一个简单的问题可以和一个陈述一样有力。

## 5. Pose a question for the reader 5.向读者提出问题

![img](images/howtostartastory-2.webp)

"The reader should be looking for an answer," says [Nathan Connolly](https://reedsy.com/nathan-connolly), an editor and the directing publisher of Dead Ink Books.
“读者应该寻找答案，”Dead Ink Books 的编辑兼总出版商内森·康诺利 (Nathan Connolly) 说。

"The opening to your novel should be a question that can only be answered by reading on. This doesn't need to be literal, or overt, it can even be poetic, or abstract, but there must be a wound that can only be healed by reading on."
“你的小说的开头应该是一个只有读下去才能回答的问题。这不需要是字面的，或公开的，甚至可以是诗意的，或抽象的，但必须有一个只能是的伤口。继续读下去就痊愈了。”

### Example: The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath 示例：《钟形罩》，西尔维娅·普拉斯

While the first line of Plath's only novel doesn't end with a question mark, it certainly poses a few mysteries.
虽然普拉斯唯一一部小说的第一行并没有以问号结尾，但它确实提出了一些谜团。

*It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York.
那是一个奇怪而闷热的夏天，罗森伯格一家被他们触电身亡，我不知道自己在纽约做什么。*

What was queer and sultry about this summer? How does the narrator's story relate to the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg? And does she actually not know why she's in the Big Apple? The only way to find out is to read on...
今年夏天有什么奇怪又闷热的事情？叙述者的故事与朱利叶斯·罗森伯格和埃塞尔·罗森伯格的处决有何关系？她真的不知道自己为什么来到纽约吗？找出答案的唯一方法是继续阅读......

说到尚未解答的问题，下一个技巧将更深入地探讨有趣的空缺这一想法。

## 6. Engage a sense of curiosity 6.激发好奇心

For in the experience of editor [Britanie Wilson](https://reedsy.com/britanie-wilson), the most successful beginnings have the magnetic effect of appealing to an emotion that all readers possess: curiosity.
根据编辑布里塔妮·威尔逊的经验，最成功的开头具有吸引所有读者都拥有的一种情感的磁力效应：好奇心。

"Make them immediately ask of your characters: *What is this place? Why are they here? What are they doing? Who is involved? Where is this going?*
“让他们立即询问你的角色：这是什么地方？他们为什么在这里？他们在做什么？谁参与其中？这是要去哪里？

"If you can pique your readers' curiosity from the very first sentence, you can will them to keep reading before they even know they like your book."
“如果你能从第一句话就激发读者的好奇心，你就可以在他们知道自己喜欢你的书之前就吸引他们继续阅读。”

### Example: "Royal Beatings", Alice Munro 示例：“皇家殴打”，爱丽丝·门罗

The first story in Munro's 1978 short story collection, *Who Do You Think You Are?* gives its readers an unusual phrase that instantly piques their curiosity. 
《你以为你是谁？》是门罗 1978 年短篇小说集的第一个故事。给读者一个不寻常的短语，立即激起他们的好奇心。

*Royal Beating. That was Flo's promise. You are going to get one Royal Beating.
皇家殴打。这是弗洛的承诺。你将会受到一次皇家殴打。*

As with the Orwell opening, the reader is presented with an unusual turn of phrase repeated several times — including in the title. By the time we're just 15-words deep into the story, we have a burning question: what *is* a Royal Beating?
与奥威尔的开头一样，读者会看到重复多次的不寻常的措辞——包括在标题中。当我们深入了解这个故事的 15 个字时，我们有一个紧迫的问题：什么是皇家殴打？

While creating curiosity and mystery is powerful, it's important that [the start of your book isn't entirely cryptic](http://www.nownovel.com/blog/ways-to-start-story-examples/). Your opening must sustain your readers' interest in some way if you are to keep them reading through to chapter two, and reveal more and more information [in the plot points to come](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/plot/plot-point/).
虽然创造好奇心和神秘感很强大，但重要的是你的书的开头不要完全神秘。如果你想让读者读到第二章，并在接下来的情节点中揭示越来越多的信息，那么你的开头必须以某种方式维持读者的兴趣。

> Pro tip: [Starting your writing with dialogue](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/how-to-write-dialogue/dialogue-examples/#1__barbara_kingsolver__unsheltered) is considered a no-no by some, but can actually be a great way of achieving this effect.
> 专家提示：从对话开始写作被一些人认为是禁忌，但实际上可能是实现这种效果的好方法。

## 7. Build a convincing world and setting 7. 建立一个令人信服的世界和背景

"To give readers the confidence to continue reading a story they've just started, it's important to give them enough detail to know where and when a story takes place," says author and ghostwriter [Tom Bromley](https://reedsy.com/learning/).
“为了让读者有信心继续阅读他们刚刚开始的故事，重要的是向他们提供足够的细节，让他们知道故事发生的地点和时间，”作家兼代笔作家汤姆布罗姆利说。

"Sometimes when stories begin, there's a danger that the scenes are a little bit 'floating' — where the reader isn't given enough information to visualize what's going on. Details of location and time, when provided with enough specificity, will *ground* the reader and make them feel secure." 
“有时，当故事开始时，存在场景有点‘浮动’的危险——读者没有获得足够的信息来想象正在发生的事情。地点和时间的细节，如果提供足够的具体性，将为故事奠定基础。读者并让他们感到安全。”

### Example: *The Corrections*, Jonathan Franzen 示例：《纠正》，乔纳森·弗兰岑

This novel, set in the American Midwest, opens by instantly grounding the reader in visuals related to the *when* and *where* of the story.
这本小说以美国中西部为背景，一开始就让读者立即陷入与故事发生的时间和地点相关的视觉效果中。

*The madness of an autumn prairie cold front coming through. You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen. The sun low in the sky, a minor light, a cooling star. Gust after gust of disorder. Trees restless, temperatures falling, the whole northern religion of things coming to an end. No children in the yards here. Shadows lengthened on yellowing zoysia. Red oaks and pin oaks and swamp white oaks rained acorns on houses with no mortgage. Storm windows shuddered in the empty bedrooms. And the drone and hiccup of a clothes dryer, the nasal contention of a leaf blower, the ripening of local apples in a paper bag, the smell of the gasoline with which Alfred Lambert had cleaned the paintbrush from his morning painting of the wicker love seat.
秋天草原冷锋的疯狂袭来。你可以感觉到：可怕的事情即将发生。太阳低垂在天空，微弱的光芒，一颗凉爽的星星。一阵阵混乱。树木焦躁不安，气温下降，整个北方宗教的事物即将结束。这里的院子里没有孩子。泛黄的结缕草上的阴影拉长了。红橡树、针橡树和沼泽白橡树给没有抵押贷款的房子下了橡子雨。空荡荡的卧室里，暴风雨的窗户颤抖着。还有干衣机的嗡嗡声和打嗝声、吹叶机的鼻腔争鸣声、纸袋里当地苹果的成熟声、阿尔弗雷德·兰伯特早上用来清洁柳条双人沙发上画笔的汽油味。 。*

If you were to think of this opening scene in a cinematic sense, it reads like a slow montage that cuts between different images that set up the tone and atmosphere of the piece. Note how the first sentence describes the wind — a classic piece of literary imagery that almost always signifies the same thing: that change is a'coming. 
如果你从电影的角度来思考这个开场场景，它读起来就像一个缓慢的蒙太奇，在不同的图像之间切换，从而设定了作品的基调和氛围。请注意第一句话是如何描述风的——这是一个经典的文学意象，几乎总是表示同一件事：变化即将到来。

## 8. Do something new with your writing 8.在你的写作中做一些新的事情

Avoiding clichés is something that should always be avoided. And in the experience of [Thalia Suzuma](https://reedsy.com/thalia-suzuma), and editor who has worked with authors ranging from David Baldacci to Ken Follett, clichés can be avoided with some simple, unusual choices:
避免陈词滥调是应该始终避免的事情。根据曾与 David Baldacci 和 Ken Follett 等作家合作过的编辑 Thalia Suzuma 的经验，可以通过一些简单、不寻常的选择来避免陈词滥调：

"Consider these two lines:
“考虑这两行：

1) I'm sitting writing this at my desk.

1）我坐在办公桌前写这篇文章。

2) I write this sitting in the kitchen sink.

2）我坐在厨房的水槽里写下这篇文章。

"Which line makes you want to read on? I'd hazard a guess that it's probably the sentence about being perched at a sink — the opening line to one of my favorite novels, *I Capture the Castle* by Dodie Smith.
“哪一行让你想继续读下去？我猜这可能是关于坐在水槽边的那句话——我最喜欢的小说之一，多迪·史密斯的《我占领城堡》的开场白。

"Say something in your first few sentences that hasn't often been said before! A brief line laden with foreboding and heavy with what has not been said often works well, too."
“在你的前几句话中说一些以前不常说的话！一句充满不祥预感和沉重的未曾说过的话的简短台词通常也很有效。”

### Example: *Jane Eyre*, Charlotte Brontë 示例：简·爱、夏洛特·勃朗特

Opening a book by talking about the weather is just about as clichéd as things come. (*It was a dark and stormy night...*) But in the opening paragraph of Jane Eyre, we are presented with an image of cold weather — but filtered through the eyes of its title character.
通过谈论天气来打开一本书几乎是陈词滥调。 （那是一个漆黑的暴风雨之夜……）但在《简·爱》的开头段落中，我们看到的是寒冷天气的形象——但通过主人公的眼睛过滤了出来。

*There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.
那天不可能散步。*

More importantly than discovering the weather in chapter one, we learn something about the narrator: that she is a woman of absolutes. 
比在第一章中发现天气更重要的是，我们了解了叙述者的一些信息：她是一个绝对的女人。

Again, the weather is used to create a sense of foreboding — a perfect segue into our next tip.
再次，天气被用来制造一种不祥的预感——完美地延续到我们的下一个技巧。

## 9. Create tension that has room to grow 9. 创造有成长空间的紧张感

Openings should be intense, but for editor [Rebecca Heyman](https://reedsy.com/rebecca-heyman), that doesn’t necessarily mean *loud* or *explosive*.
开场应该是激烈的，但对于编辑丽贝卡·海曼来说，这并不一定意味着大声或爆炸性的。

"So many authors are keen to start with a literal bang — something going up in flames, or a car accident, or some other catastrophe. But recall that even a smoldering fire can burn your hand; draw us in like moths to the flame, but don’t let the bonfire rage so fierce we can’t get close."
“很多作者都热衷于从字面意义上的爆炸开始——一些东西着火了，或者一场车祸，或者其他一些灾难。但请记住，即使是阴燃的火也会烧伤你的手；把我们像飞蛾扑向火焰一样吸引，但别让篝火熊熊燃烧，我们无法靠近。”

### Example: *All The Light We Cannot See,* Anthony Doerr 示例：《我们看不到的所有光》，安东尼·多尔

Remember what we said about winds signifying change? In the opening chapter of Anthony Doerr's novel set around the Second World War, we open with a description of the wind, bringing with it a literal message of change:
还记得我们说过风代表变化吗？在安东尼·杜尔以第二次世界大战为背景的小说的开篇，我们以对风的描述开始，带来了变化的字面信息：

*At dusk they pour from the sky. They blow across the ramparts, turn cartwheels over rooftops, flutter into the ravines between houses. Entire streets swirl with them, flashing white against the cobbles. Urgent message to the inhabitants of this town, they say. Depart immediately to open country.
黄昏时分，它们从天而降。它们吹过城墙，在屋顶上翻滚，扑进房屋之间的峡谷。整条街道都充满了它们，在鹅卵石的映衬下闪闪发光。他们说，这是给该镇居民的紧急信息。立即出发前往开阔的乡村。*

This image we're presented with is almost playful (turning cartwheels, fluttering into ravines), making the message the pamphlets bear even more insidious.
我们看到的这个形象几乎是有趣的（侧手翻、扑进峡谷），使得小册子所传达的信息更加阴险。

For the final tip of this post, we give you what is perhaps the cardinal rule of starting a story...
对于这篇文章的最后一点，我们给你可能是开始一个故事的基本规则......

## 10. Capture your readers’ attention 10.吸引读者的注意力

You want your reader to be swept up in the story— for its entirety, but especially at the beginning, says editor [Anne McPeak:](https://reedsy.com/anne-mcpeak)
你希望你的读者完全沉浸在故事中，尤其是在开头，编辑安妮·麦克皮克说：

"This is your chance to intoxicate your reader and convince them that they can’t not read on. This doesn’t mean your story needs drama, or fireworks, or shocking material; what your story really needs is close attention to language, tone, and pacing.
“这是你让读者陶醉并让他们无法不读下去的机会。这并不意味着你的故事需要戏剧性、烟花或令人震惊的材料；你的故事真正需要的是对语言、语气的密切关注和节奏。

"Dazzle your reader from the start, and they will willingly take your hand for the ride." 
“从一开始就让你的读者眼花缭乱，他们会愿意牵着你的手一起走。”

### Example: *Fortress of Solitude*, Jonathan Lethem 示例：孤独堡垒，乔纳森·莱瑟姆

Centering on the lives of two friends in Brooklyn and spanning decades, Lethem's novel opens with an everyday image — of girls rollerskating on the sidewalk — and filters it through the eyes of a narrator, who interprets the scene in quite an arresting fashion that's bound to capture the reader's attention:
莱瑟姆的小说以布鲁克林两个朋友的生活为中心，跨越数十年，以一个日常形象开始——女孩在人行道上滑旱冰——并通过叙述者的眼睛过滤它，叙述者以一种相当引人注目的方式解释了这一场景，这必然会引起读者的注意。吸引读者的注意力：

*Like a match struck in a darkened room:
就像在黑暗的房间里划燃的火柴一样：*

*Two white girls in flannel nightgowns and red vinyl roller skates with white laces, tracing tentative circles on a cracked blue slate sidewalk at seven o'clock on an evening in July.
七月的一个晚上七点钟，两个穿着法兰绒睡衣和白色鞋带的红色乙烯基溜冰鞋的白人女孩，在破裂的蓝色石板人行道上试探性地划着圈。*

*The girls murmured rhymes, were murmured rhymes, their gauzy, sky-pink hair streaming like it had never once been cut.
女孩们低声哼着儿歌，低声哼着儿歌，她们那轻纱般的天粉色头发飘逸着，就像从来没有剪过一样。*

Establishing best practices for starting a story can be tricky because, as Nathan Connolly says, “Fiction should, by nature, seek to defy, redefine or expand beyond rules." It should not be an author’s goal to emulate the words or tastes of another person while writing a novel.
建立故事开头的最佳实践可能很棘手，因为正如内森·康诺利所说，“小说本质上应该寻求挑战、重新定义或超越规则。”作者的目标不应该是模仿他人的言语或品味。写小说时的人。

However, many well-loved novels share a thread of commonality when it comes to their first few lines — such as a question, a brief to-the-point line, or in the middle of action. While there’s no hard rule for what works, these are guidelines you can follow when determining how to hook readers down your story’s path.
然而，许多深受喜爱的小说在前几行中都有一个共同点——例如问题、简短的切中要害的台词或动作的中间部分。虽然没有什么硬性规定，但在确定如何吸引读者阅读你的故事时，你可以遵循这些指导原则。

### How you start your story could cost you readers 如何开始你的故事可能会让你的读者付出代价

How you start your story will decide whether or not your reader sticks with you. It should tell them what to expect in terms of tone and plot, and leave them in no doubt as to why they should care about what happens next.
你如何开始你的故事将决定你的读者是否会坚持你。它应该告诉他们在基调和情节方面会发生什么，并让他们毫无疑问地知道为什么他们应该关心接下来会发生什么。

Your [first chapter](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/write-the-first-chapter) should also assure the reader that *something* is going to happen, and that your protagonist will be an interesting character to follow.
你的第一章还应该向读者保证将会发生一些事情，并且你的主角将是一个有趣的角色。



### Your opening could make or break your publishing deal 你的空缺可能决定你的出版交易的成败

[Literary agents](https://www.thenovelry.com/literary-agents) and publishing houses tend to request the first three chapters at the point of submission (but please always check their specific guidelines first, as this can vary). Often, they make a judgment on your book and your writing voice from the very first sentence.
文学代理商和出版社往往在提交时要求提供前三章（但请务必先检查他们的具体指南，因为这可能会有所不同）。通常，他们从第一句话就对你的书和你的写作声音做出判断。

Of course, the pitch or[ hook for your novel](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/how-to-write-a-hook-for-your-novel), and your cover letter, are also very important (and[ The Novelry](https://www.thenovelry.com/) can help with both!), but the novel’s opening is vital.
当然，小说的基调或吸引点以及求职信也非常重要（小说可以在这两方面提供帮助！），但小说的开头至关重要。

This is your chance to make your voice heard, and make a case for your story. As award-winning author[ Louise Doughty](https://www.louisedoughty.com/) told us during her live session with The Novelry:
这是您表达自己的声音并为您的故事辩护的机会。正如获奖作家 Louise Doughty 在 The Novelry 的现场会议中告诉我们的那样：



> When it comes to sending your work to agents, publishers and so on, consciously or subconsciously, they will almost certainly make their mind up by the end of the first page – if not before… It really is ‘first impressions are everything’.
> 当您有意或无意地将您的作品发送给代理商、出版商等时，他们几乎肯定会在第一页结束时做出决定 - 如果不是之前……这确实是“第一印象决定一切”。
> — Louise Doughty                                                    — 路易丝·道蒂

## When to write the start of your story 什么时候写你的故事的开头

By the time you’re writing the start of your story for the last time, you’ll likely have finished the first draft. Writing a novel is not a linear, step by step process!
当你最后一次写故事的开头时，你可能已经完成了初稿。写小说不是一个线性的、一步一步的过程！

For those just starting out, this should relieve some of the pressure. Get *yourself* started and you can revisit your opening when you know the intricacies of your characters and plot, and the nooks and crannies where tension and fascination lurk.
对于那些刚刚起步的人来说，这应该可以减轻一些压力。开始吧，当你了解角色和情节的复杂性，以及潜伏着紧张和魅力的角落和缝隙时，你就可以重新审视你的开场白。

It’s much easier to write the beginning (and maintain a strong narrative voice) when you know the ending.
当你知道结局时，写开头（并保持强有力的叙述声音）会容易得多。

So if you’re reading this and you’re just about to start the writing process, by all means read on! But be sure to revisit this page and all its linked resources when you come – as you probably will – to revising your opening.
因此，如果您正在阅读本文并且即将开始写作过程，请务必继续阅读！但是，当您要修改开头时（您可能会这样做），请务必重新访问此页面及其所有链接资源。
                                                      

## Questions to ask yourself before you think about the 在考虑之前要问自己的问题opening lines 开场白

If you’re about to start writing your opening for the first time, you’ll need to be clear about the core elements of your novel.
如果您要第一次开始写开头，您需要清楚小说的核心要素。

And if you’ve finished your first draft and are looking to liven up the opening or first few lines, check whether the answers to these questions are there – even if they’re simmering below the surface.
如果你已经完成了初稿，并且希望让开头或前几行变得生动，请检查这些问题的答案是否存在 - 即使它们在表面之下酝酿。

![img](images/657cb783c3df5d1f08a38ed8_IEbFAdPmRk24OOvGIQA8_key_questions_on_how_to_start_a_story.webp)

You can also see whether your initial answers to these questions are still satisfactory in light of how you’ve moved the story forward. Rethinking some of these might not only give you the compelling start you’re looking for, but actually revolutionise your entire story.  
您还可以根据您如何推动故事发展来查看您对这些问题的最初答案是否仍然令人满意。重新思考其中的一些可能不仅会给你带来你正在寻找的令人信服的开始，而且实际上会彻底改变你的整个故事。

1. Who is telling the story? An outside observer? A first person narrator?
   谁在讲这个故事？外部观察员？第一人称叙述者？
2. Who’s the main character? Whose actions will we be following?
   主角是谁？我们将遵循谁的行动？
3. Who/what is the antagonist?
   对手是谁/什么？
4. Where and when are we?
   我们什么时候在哪里？
5. What’s the situation/problem?
   情况/问题是什么？
6. Why should the reader care?
   读者为什么要关心？
7. What question does your novel answer (or ask!)?
   你的小说回答（或提出）什么问题？
                                                        

## Components commonly found in cracking openings 裂纹开口处常见的成分

If you want to start your stories in a way that sticks with readers, this checklist is a good place to start.
如果你想以一种吸引读者的方式开始你的故事，这个清单是一个很好的起点。

Armed with some of these tools (and note these are not ‘rules’ – you won’t need *every* one of these for your opening!), you might whittle your opening into something even more spectacular.
有了其中一些工具（请注意，这些不是“规则”——您的开场白不需要每一个！），您可能会将您的开场白变成更壮观的东西。

1. A hook/question/mystery/omission
   一个钩子/问题/谜团/遗漏
2. Interesting character(s)
   有趣的角色
3. What that character wants and/or needs – and what stops them from getting it
   该角色想要和/或需要什么——以及什么阻止他们得到它
4. Stakes! 赌注！
5. A strong setting  强大的设定
6. Clear tone and mood
   清晰的语气和情绪
7. A statement/thesis 陈述/论文
8. The problem(s) of the first chapter…
   第一章的问题...

### Start your story with an engaging hook 用引人入胜的挂钩开始你的故事

By the time a reader finishes your first chapter, there should be some sort of question they’re yearning to answer. It could be something literal, but it needn’t be!
当读者读完你的第一章时，他们应该有某种渴望回答的问题。它可能是字面意思，但不一定如此！

> A fine balance between confusion, mystery and illumination… It’s a tightrope walk, that first chapter. You want the reader drawn in by mystery but not eaten by the grue of confusion, and so you illuminate a little bit as you go – a flashlight beam on the wall or along the ground, just enough to keep them walking forward and not impaling themselves on a stalagmite.
> 混乱、神秘和启发之间的微妙平衡……第一章就像走钢丝。你希望读者被神秘所吸引，但又不会被混乱所吞噬，所以你在阅读时会照亮一点——在墙上或沿着地面的手电筒光束，足以让他们继续前进而不至于刺伤自己在石笋上。
> — Chuck Wendig — 查克·温迪格

Whatever your core question, it must be something that we can only resolve by reading on – and which makes reading on irresistible.
无论你的核心问题是什么，它一定是我们只能通过阅读才能解决的问题——这使得阅读变得不可抗拒。

That’s why having great story hooks is so important. They don’t just sharpen your first few lines, they guide your entire story!
这就是为什么拥有精彩的故事情节如此重要。它们不仅让你的前几行变得更加清晰，而且还指导你的整个故事！



### Introduce an interesting character at the start of your story 在故事的开头介绍一个有趣的角色

It’s often a good idea to introduce your protagonist pretty early in your first chapter, rather than doing too much world-building. Your reader wants somebody to connect with, so if none of your main characters has a strong presence in the first chapter, it might be difficult to pique the reader’s interest.
在第一章中尽早介绍主角通常是一个好主意，而不是做太多的世界建设。你的读者想要与某人建立联系，所以如果你的主要角色在第一章中没有一个强有力的存在，那么可能很难激起读者的兴趣。

Remember: it doesn’t have to mean introducing your protagonist/hero right away! Readers often love a compelling bad guy, so if you think introducing us to your antagonist first works better, why not try writing your opening that way?
请记住：这并不一定意味着立即介绍您的主角/英雄！读者通常喜欢引人注目的坏人，所以如果你认为首先向我们介绍你的对手效果更好，为什么不尝试这样写你的开场白呢？

Again, this is by no means a hard and fast rule. Starting with someone on the periphery could be powerful. But if you feel the opening is lagging, or not living up to the rest of the story, this could be an interesting component to play with.
再次强调，这绝不是一条硬性规定。从外围的人开始可能会很有效。但如果你觉得开头有些滞后，或者没有达到故事的其余部分，这可能是一个有趣的组成部分。

It’s possible that your character doesn’t know what they need, or possibly even what they want. Or perhaps what they want isn’t what they need…
你的角色可能不知道他们需要什么，甚至可能不知道他们想要什么。或者也许他们想要的并不是他们需要的......

Whatever the case, there should be a compulsion or desire, or something they’re lacking, to guide their actions throughout the novel. It’s probably also the crux of their character development. Give us some insight into what that is, and other obstacles that stand in their way.
不管怎样，在整部小说中都应该有一种强迫或欲望，或者他们所缺乏的东西来指导他们的行动。这可能也是他们性格发展的关键。请让我们深入了解这是什么，以及阻碍他们的其他障碍。



### Set the stakes and the stage for character development 为角色发展设定赌注和舞台

One thing’s for sure: when it comes to story writing, stakes are indispensable.
有一点是肯定的：写故事的时候，赌注是不可或缺的。

Stakes can mean different things for different stories in different genres. It doesn’t have to be a high-speed car chase or an axe-wielding murderer!
对于不同类型的不同故事，赌注可能意味着不同的事情。不一定是高速汽车追逐或挥舞斧头的凶手！

But any good story starts when something has just changed, *or is about to*. We tend to begin when a blip (or blast) in the character’s everyday life sets them on to a new path.
但任何好故事都是在事情刚刚发生或即将发生变化时开始的。我们倾向于从角色日常生活中的一个小插曲（或爆炸）让他们走上一条新道路开始。



### Place the reader in a strong setting 将读者置于一个强有力的环境中

Setting the stage as you start your story can feel like a balancing act. You need to create a vivid, enveloping world, but you don’t want to test your reader’s patience.
在开始故事时设置舞台感觉像是一种平衡行为。你需要创造一个生动、包容的世界，但你不想考验读者的耐心。

We don’t need to know about the weather unless it helps with atmosphere; then whether it’s a sultry summer day might be a way of giving a nod to the reader that temperatures are rising! Learn to layer up setting descriptions not just with sensory detail but also to give a flavour of what’s distinctive about your story, for example in the famous book by George Orwell, the year Nineteen Eighty Four includes the sort of bright cold day we might expect in any April, but in this case, the clocks are striking thirteen.
我们不需要了解天气，除非它有助于改善气氛；那么，是否是一个闷热的夏日可能是向读者暗示气温正在上升的一种方式！学会对场景描述进行分层，不仅要包含感官细节，还要赋予你的故事独特的风味，例如在乔治·奥威尔的名著中，十九八十四年包括我们可能期望的那种明亮寒冷的日子任何四月，但在这种情况下，时钟都会敲十三下。

Here again, being guided by a strong character helps. Instead of telling us *everything* about the setting in the opening scene, why not focus on what’s important to the character?
在这里，坚强的性格引导会有所帮助。与其在开场场景中告诉我们有关场景的所有信息，为什么不关注对角色重要的事情呢？

It’s also worth thinking about how the place itself might drive the action and plot. In fact, lots of writers (including many of the wonderful[ writing coaches](https://www.thenovelry.com/coaching/writers) at The Novelry!) find inspiration for their stories in a setting.
还值得思考的是这个地方本身如何推动动作和情节。事实上，许多作家（包括 The Novelry 的许多出色的写作教练！）都是在某个场景中为他们的故事找到灵感的。



### Start your story with a definitive tone and mood 以明确的语气和情绪开始你的故事

Your opening is your introduction – a calling card of sorts. And like meeting new friends or going on a first date, you don’t want to give a false first impression or set unrealistic expectations.
你的开场白就是你的介绍——某种名片。就像结识新朋友或第一次约会一样，您不想给人留下错误的第一印象或设定不切实际的期望。

Received wisdom says not to judge a book by its cover, but you wouldn’t want to use an image of a woman clutching a man’s bare and toned torso aboard a wind-tousled ship for a novel about a cosy 1930s murder mystery. That would be confusing!
人们普遍认为，不要以貌取人，但你也不会想在一本讲述 1930 年代谋杀悬疑小说的小说中使用一个女人在一艘被风吹乱的船上抓着一个男人赤裸而健美的躯干的形象。那会很混乱！

Of course, you can surprise your reader. But in general – and especially for a debut novel – it can be wise to stick broadly to your chosen genre(s) and the tone you establish (ideally from the very first sentence) within your story.
当然，你可以给你的读者带来惊喜。但总的来说，尤其是对于处女作而言，明智的做法是广泛坚持您选择的类型和您在故事中建立的基调（最好从第一句话开始）。

It could be quite jarring for a reader if a gritty, bleak, social commentary becomes a quippy and upbeat jaunt across Europe, for example.  
例如，如果一篇坚韧、阴暗的社会评论变成了一次穿越欧洲的俏皮而乐观的短途旅行，这可能会让读者感到非常不舒服。

That being said, you don’t want to make your opening sentence bland for fear you may stray from the path you’ve chosen. Having the opening sentence place the reader in a ‘dark and stormy night’ may have been effective *once*, but it’s pretty played out now.
话虽这么说，你不想让你的开场白变得平淡无奇，因为担心你可能会偏离你选择的道路。让读者置身于“漆黑的暴风雨之夜”曾经可能是有效的，但现在已经很有效了。

All you need to do is establish your writing voice and create an overall tone and mood that fit your genre, theme and setting. You can even do this through action in the opening line; think of that clock striking thirteen, or the day that grandmother exploded.
您所需要做的就是建立您的写作风格，并创造适合您的流派、主题和背景的整体基调和情绪。您甚至可以通过开场白中的动作来做到这一点；想想那个时钟敲响十三点，或者祖母爆炸的那天。



### Hint at the statement/thesis your novel probes 暗示你的小说所探讨的陈述/论文

Once again, this can take innumerable forms, but it can be good to give your reader some clues as to what your novel might investigate, prove or debunk.
再说一遍，这可以采取无数的形式，但最好为你的读者提供一些线索，让他们知道你的小说可能调查、证明或揭穿什么。

In The Novelry courses, we often think about this as the lie. What is the lie this book reveals?
在小说课程中，我们经常认为这是谎言。这本书揭露了什么谎言？

Why not look at some[ great opening scenes from films](https://industrialscripts.com/opening-scenes/) and how they convey their overarching themes? Granted, films have a whole different set of tools available, but what can you learn from them? You might find some surprising inspiration!
为什么不看看电影中一些精彩的开场场景以及它们如何传达总体主题呢？诚然，电影有一套完全不同的可用工具，但你能从中学到什么？您可能会发现一些令人惊讶的灵感！



### Include the problem(s) of a first chapter as you start your story 在开始故事时包括第一章的问题

The problem precipitating a story is usually with the state of rest that exists before the story begins. This is typically a pretty indispensable ingredient in a first chapter.
引发故事的问题通常与故事开始之前存在的休息状态有关。这通常是第一章中不可或缺的要素。

You might also want to give the reader an idea of why this state of rest has been/is about to be disrupted – disclose or hint at your inciting incident.
您可能还想让读者了解为什么这种休息状态已经/即将被破坏——披露或暗示您的煽动事件。

**But remember** that in some of the most compelling stories, the apparent or suggested problem is not the *real* problem that drives the narrative. Instead, there’s a hidden problem. The protagonist is typically blind to it, but your savvy readers will catch it. It could be an unspoken trauma or unrealised threat, for example, or even an obstacle to the thing the protagonist doesn’t know they want!
但请记住，在一些最引人注目的故事中，明显或暗示的问题并不是推动叙事的真正问题。相反，有一个隐藏的问题。主角通常对此视而不见，但精明的读者会发现它。例如，这可能是一种不言而喻的创伤或未实现的威胁，甚至是主角不知道自己想要的东西的障碍！

If you’re interested in these hidden problems, [The Novelry’s Advanced Class](https://www.thenovelry.com/classes/the-advanced-class) explores them in more depth, along with shining examples to bring it all to life.
如果您对这些隐藏的问题感兴趣，The Novelry 的高级课程将更深入地探讨它们，并提供生动的例子来将其变为现实。
                                                 

## How to start a story: the opening line 如何开始一个故事：开场白

If the first chapter can strike panic into a writer’s heart, [the first sentence](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/first-lines-of-novels) could be the brink of an existential crisis.
如果说第一章可以让作家内心感到恐慌，那么第一句话就可能是生存危机的边缘。

Fear not! The first sentence doesn’t have to be a work of genius. Your first words needn’t neatly sum up the truth of life, or even the meaning of your novel. They just need to start your story.
不要害怕！第一句话不一定是天才的作品。你的第一句话不需要简洁地概括生活的真相，甚至不需要概括你小说的意义。他们只需要开始你的故事。

![img](images/657cb783c3df5d1f08a38edc_zJtwTl8DRlyntoSqwlEV_how_to_start_a_story_your_opening_line.webp)

And that’s not only true for a casual reader. Super star[ literary agent Marilia Savvides](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/how-to-open-a-novel) feels just the same about the opening line:
这不仅适用于普通读者。超级明星文学经纪人 Marilia Savvides 对开场白也有同样的感觉：

> First lines are certainly not everything. I’ve read hundreds of novels I’ve adored which began in very simple, straightforward ways. Even unmemorable beginnings can work well, and often they can be preferable to overly written beginnings that are trying too hard.
> 第一行当然不是全部。我读过数百本我喜欢的小说，它们的开头都非常简单、直接。即使是不令人难忘的开头也能起到很好的效果，而且通常它们比写得太过努力的开头更可取。
> — Marilia Savvides — 玛丽莉亚·萨维迪斯

The most important thing is authenticity and confidence. Don’t use the voice of other writers when you begin. Instead, announce your presence on the page from the first sentence with a strong narrative voice, and have confidence in your prose and in your story. Introduce your distinctive voice from the get-go.
最重要的是真实性和信心。开始时不要使用其他作家的声音。相反，从第一句话开始就以强有力的叙述声音宣布您在页面上的存在，并对您的散文和故事充满信心。从一开始就介绍您独特的声音。

> There are all sorts of theories and ideas about what constitutes a good opening line… To get scientific about it is a little like trying to catch moonbeams in a jar… There’s one thing I’m sure about. An opening line should invite the reader to begin the story. It should say: Listen. Come in here. You want to know about this.
> 关于什么是好的开场白，有各种各样的理论和想法……要获得科学性，有点像试图在罐子里捕捉月光……有一件事我确信。开场白应该邀请读者开始讲故事。应该说：听着。进来吧。你想了解这一点。
> — Stephen King - 斯蒂芬·金

And if you want some very practical, actionable advice on how to write the opening sentence, we can turn once again to Louise Doughty’s brilliant live session with us. She shared a simple nugget of wisdom: start your story with a specific and declarative sentence.
如果您想要一些关于如何写开头句的非常实用、可操作的建议，我们可以再次转向 Louise Doughty 与我们进行的精彩现场会议。她分享了一个简单的智慧：用一个具体的陈述性句子开始你的故事。
                                              

## When to start your story 何时开始你的故事

The question of *when* to start your story might seem to have an obvious answer: at the beginning. Hehe.
何时开始你的故事的问题似乎有一个明显的答案：从一开始。呵呵。

But take a moment to reflect on whether that really is the most compelling way to spin your tale.
但请花点时间思考一下这是否真的是最有说服力的编造故事的方式。

Bestselling author Val McDermid offered some *brilliant* advice on [structuring a story](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/val-mcdermid) in her blog post for us, and it works just as well whether you’re writing a short story or a weighty tome. For the ins and outs, check out the full article, but it goes a little like this – we’ll borrow McDermid’s real-life example.
畅销书作家瓦尔·麦克德米德（Val McDermid）在她的博客文章中为我们提供了一些关于构建故事的绝妙建议，无论您是在写短篇小说还是厚重的大部头，它都同样有效。有关详细信息，请查看完整的文章，但它有点像这样——我们将借用麦克德米德的现实生活中的例子。

### 

### How would you start this story with a friend? 你会如何与朋友开始这个故事？

Stories, by their very nature, almost always have a beginning, a middle and an end. But we don’t necessarily tell them in that order.
故事就其本质而言，几乎总是有开头、中间和结尾。但我们不一定按这个顺序告诉他们。

Think back to anecdotes you’ve shared with your friends over a few drinks. Sometimes you begin at the beginning. In McDermid’s great example, you might begin: ‘John picked me up to go fishing this morning.’
回想一下您在喝了几杯酒后与朋友分享的轶事。有时你会从头开始。在麦克德米德的伟大例子中，你可以这样开始：“约翰今天早上带我去钓鱼。”

But other times, you’ve probably decided to start your tale right in the middle – we know starting *in media res* can be powerful: ‘So there we were, out in the middle of the loch, when John suddenly realised he’d left the back door open.’
但其他时候，你可能决定从中间开始你的故事 - 我们知道从媒体资源开始可能会很强大：“所以我们就在那里，在湖中央，当约翰突然意识到他已经离开了后门打开了。

And you might even have begun stories at the end, making your friends desperate to learn how you got yourself into such a pickle: ‘You’re probably wondering why I’m sitting here in the pub all wet and covered in fish scales.’
你甚至可能在最后开始讲故事，让你的朋友迫切地想知道你是如何陷入这样的困境的：“你可能想知道为什么我浑身湿透，浑身都是鱼鳞，坐在酒吧里。”

McDermid’s advice is simple:
麦克德米德的建议很简单：

> Imagine you’re having a drink with your best friend. Where would you start telling them your story in a way that makes sense?
> 想象一下你正在和你最好的朋友喝酒。你会从哪里开始以一种有意义的方式告诉他们你的故事？
> — Val McDermid — 瓦尔·麦克德米德

When you’re stuck on how to start a story, pause and think about whether there’s a gripping midpoint you want to show the reader before taking them back to the beginning. Or is revealing your conclusion and then working backwards – á la[ murder mystery](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/ruth-ware), for example – going to be more effective for you?
当你不知道如何开始一个故事时，停下来想一想，在把读者带回到开头之前，你是否想向他们展示一个扣人心弦的中点。或者先揭示你的结论，然后倒推——例如谋杀之谜——对你来说会更有效吗？

And if the answer is that beginning at the beginning makes the most sense, then that is, of course, how you should start your story! Ultimately, you *must* always do things your own way.
如果答案是从头开始最有意义，那么当然，这就是您应该如何开始您的故事！最终，你必须始终按照自己的方式做事。
                                               

## Should you start your story with a prologue? 你应该以序言开始你的故事吗？

One thing that often comes up when writers are pondering how to start a story is the prologue.
当作家考虑如何开始一个故事时，经常出现的一件事就是序言。

Of course, whether they’re right for you depends on the story you’re telling and how you want to tell it.
当然，它们是否适合您取决于您​​要讲述的故事以及您想如何讲述它。

Generally speaking, though, people writing in crime, thriller, mystery or suspense genres might especially want to consider a punchy prologue.
不过，一般来说，写犯罪、惊悚、悬疑或悬疑类型的人可能特别想考虑一个有力的序言。

![img](images/657cb783c3df5d1f08a38edb_n4T6Mi5cR1ulMXqTYhGO_how_to_start_a_story_with_a_prologue.webp)

And if you’re worried about getting published, rest assured that most readers, agents and publishers are open to prologues.
如果您担心出版，请放心，大多数读者、代理商和出版商都对序言持开放态度。

For example, Marilia Savvides told us:
例如，Marilia Savvides 告诉我们：

> There’s something about an author dropping us into the middle of the bad thing or the difficult thing, the thing that will come much later, showing you just enough of a peek to grip you, before yanking you away. When done well, and if it’s right for your book, a good prologue can be the answer you’re looking for.
> 作者让我们陷入糟糕的事情或困难的事情之中，这些事情会在很久以后发生，在把你拉走之前，向你展示足以抓住你的一瞥。如果做得好，并且适合您的书，那么一个好的序言可能就是您正在寻找的答案。
> — Marilia Savvides — 玛丽莉亚·萨维迪斯

If you *are* writing a prologue, remember that it’s not a first chapter. It’s generally more succinct, and rather than part of the ‘body proper’ of the book, it’s more of a supplement to the blurb.
如果您正在写序言，请记住这不是第一章。它通常更简洁，而不是本书“正文”的一部分，它更像是对简介的补充。

If you want lots of[ tips on how to write a prologue, we’ve got you covered](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/how-to-write-a-prologue).
如果您需要有关如何编写序言的大量技巧，我们可以满足您的要求。
                                             

## How to know if your opening is ready 如何知道您的空缺是否准备就绪

Picture this. You’re thinking about submitting your first 1–3 chapters to publishers and agents. Are you tempted to cobble two of your chapters together so you can send them that little bit more, so they get to the *really* good bit?
想象一下这个。您正在考虑将前 1-3 章提交给出版商和代理商。你是否想把你的两章拼凑在一起，这样你就可以多发一点，让他们得到真正好的部分？

Are you silently praying that they’ll skim through the first few pages and make it to that paragraph of genius halfway through chapter 3? To that part where they’ll really ‘get’ the novel?
你是否在默默祈祷他们能够浏览前几页并在第三章中途看到那段天才的段落？到了他们真正“理解”小说的那部分？

If that sounds familiar, there’s a chance you haven’t started your story quite where or how you should.  
如果这听起来很熟悉，那么您可能还没有在应该的位置或方式开始您的故事。

Look at that section you hope they’ll read to. Could that be your opener?
看看你希望他们读到的部分。这会是你的开场白吗？

Try cutting out the first paragraph. Try two paragraphs, even three. Are we spared unnecessary exposition and placed straight in the juicy bits?
尝试删掉第一段。尝试两个段落，甚至三个。我们是否省去了不必要的阐述而直接进入有趣的部分？

## Common pitfalls 常见陷阱

Of course, not all of these approaches are necessarily bad writing, and there’s no one-size-fits-all process for how to start a story. These are just things to consider if you have a needling feeling that the start of your story is not quite right.
当然，并非所有这些方法都一定是糟糕的写作，并且对于如何开始一个故事没有一刀切的过程。如果您感觉故事的开头不太对劲，那么您需要考虑这些事情。

1. Over-exposition 过度曝光
2. Over-writing 重写
3. Starting your story too early
   太早开始你的故事
4. Introducing your whole cast of characters
   介绍一下你的全部角色

### 

### 1. Did you start your story with heavy-handed exposition? 1. 你的故事是不是以严厉的阐述开始的？

When you know a world and a character so well, it’s tempting to tell your reader all about them. But remember that well-worn adage, *? It’s well-worn for a reason!*
当你非常了解一个世界和一个角色时，你很容易就会向读者讲述它们的一切。但还记得那句老生常谈的格言吗？它磨损是有原因的！

Literary agent Marilia Savvides echoed this sentiment when thinking about how to start a story: ‘one of the most common mistakes I come across when reading submissions is stuffing that first chapter with too much information.
文学经纪人 Marilia Savvides 在考虑如何开始一个故事时也表达了这种观点：“我在阅读投稿时遇到的最常见错误之一就是在第一章中填充了太多信息。

> Too much exposition can kill the drama.
> 过多的阐述会扼杀戏剧性。
> — Marilia Savvides — 玛丽莉亚·萨维迪斯

### 2. Could the start of your story be over-written? 2. 你的故事的开头可以重写吗？

Over-exposition may be the first and most common mistake Marilia mentioned, but a close second was over-writing.
过度阐述可能是玛丽莉亚提到的第一个也是最常见的错误，但紧随其后的是过度写作。

Authors eager for agents to read their beautiful turns of phrase and literary skills in the first pages pick their ‘darling’ sentences – often those that feel profound or poetic – and use them to start a story.  
作者渴望让代理人在第一页中阅读他们美丽的措辞和文学技巧，挑选他们的“亲爱的”句子——通常是那些感觉深刻或富有诗意的句子——并用它们来开始一个故事。

The problem, according to Marilia, is that those beautiful moments are more impactful scattered throughout the book:
根据玛丽莉亚的说法，问题在于那些美丽的时刻更具影响力，分散在整本书中：

> The story must take centre stage. It has to.
> 故事必须占据中心舞台。必须如此。
> — Marilia Savvides — 玛丽莉亚·萨维迪斯

### 3. Have you given the game away or loaded in all the action? 3. 你是否已经放弃了游戏或者加载了所有的动作？

The start of your story certainly needs to tell us what to expect in terms of tone, genre and even theme, but generally, it won’t give away the whole plot or be a single-dose serving of the action.
故事的开头当然需要告诉我们在基调、类型甚至主题方面的期望，但一般来说，它不会泄露整个情节，也不会成为单一的动作内容。

This is often another symptom of wanting to impress agents and publishers right away. But remember, they’ll have the [synopsis](https://www.thenovelry.com/blog/how-to-write-a-synopsis) to get a full sense of where your story is going. There’s no need to pack it all in when you start a story!
这通常是想要立即给代理商和出版商留下深刻印象的另一个症状。但请记住，他们会提供概要，以充分了解您的故事的进展情况。当你开始一个故事时，没有必要把所有的东西都包含进去！



### 4. Have you started your story before it begins? 4. 你的故事在开始之前就已经开始了吗？

It can be helpful for you, the author, to know how your protagonist ended up in a sticky situation, or why they’re about to undergo drastic change. But readers can get a sense of this throughout the book – you don’t need to info-dump in your story beginnings.
作为作者，了解你的主角如何陷入困境，或者为什么他们即将经历巨大的变化，可能会对你有所帮助。但读者可以在整本书中感受到这一点——你不需要在故事的开头就抛出信息。

There’s a special pleasure for the reader in piecing it all together. Don’t take it away!
将所有内容拼凑在一起对读者来说是一种特别的乐趣。别把它拿走！



### 5. Have you introduced *all* your characters? 5.你介绍过所有角色了吗？

An endless conveyor belt of characters might not be the best way to start your story. Generally, we can’t keep track of who’s who if there are a dozen people dancing on the first page!
无尽的角色传送带可能不是开始故事的最佳方式。一般来说，如果第一页有十几个人在跳舞，我们就分不清谁是谁了！

You might also test your readers’ capacities for attention, investment and empathy, so start your introductions slowly, lest readers immediately lose track (or interest).
您还可以测试读者的注意力、投入和同理心的能力，因此慢慢地开始介绍，以免读者立即迷失方向（或兴趣）。

# 10 good ways to start a story 开始故事的 10 种好方法

Begin your story well and you will hook readers from the off 好好开始你的故事，你就会从一开始就吸引读者好好地开始你的故事，你会从一开始就吸引读者 好好开始你的故事，你就会从一开始就吸引读者

Every story has to start somewhere. It almost doesn’t matter how you start, but it matters that you start. So start your story. Whatever it takes to get you writing.
每个故事都必须从某个地方开始。你如何开始几乎并不重要，但重要的是你开始了。那么开始你的故事吧。不惜一切代价让你写作。

Later, the start of your story will matter very much, because it’s the first thing people will read, and if it doesn’t work, they won’t read on. Even if you’ve written the most brilliant piece of fiction this century – especially if that’s what you’ve written – pay particular attention to the beginning so that the rest of your work gets the chance it deserves to shine.
稍后，故事的开头将非常重要，因为这是人们阅读的第一件事，如果不起作用，他们就不会继续读下去。即使你写了本世纪最精彩的小说——尤其是你所写的——也要特别注意开头，这样你的其余作品就有机会大放异彩。

So, how to begin a story? Let's start with just one basic tip: you don’t have to begin at the beginning. You can start it at any point in the process. You don’t have to stick with the first line you think of. Or the second, or the third. The only thing that matters is that the beginning of your story hooks its reader and makes them want to read on. It’s worth taking time to think of good ways to start your story, so follow our tips on how to write your beginning.
那么，如何开始一个故事呢？让我们从一个基本技巧开始：您不必从头开始。您可以在此过程中的任何时刻启动它。你不必坚持你想到的第一行。或者第二个，或者第三个。唯一重要的是故事的开头吸引读者并让他们想继续读下去。花时间思考开始你的故事的好方法是值得的，所以请遵循我们关于如何写你的开头的提示。

 

## **Spark a reader’s interest 激发读者的兴趣**

At the start of a story, all you want is for readers to read on. So make sure you begin in a way that makes them want to with our tips. Pose a question; introduce a character; set a scene; lure them in with enticing prose; lay a clue to the direction the novel is going to take; plant the seeds of an idea; create a dramatic impression; give them a taste of action. There are lots of ways to start a story but what they all have in common is that to be effective they need to make a reader want to carry on reading. The first few lines are the calling card to get readers (which vitally means agents, editors and publishers) interested enough in your story to read on.
在故事的开头，您只想让读者继续阅读。因此，请确保您以一种让他们愿意听我们的建议的方式开始。提出问题；介绍一个人物；设定一个场景；用诱人的散文引诱他们；为小说的发展方向提供线索；播下想法的种子；创造戏剧性的印象；让他们尝尝行动的滋味。开始一个故事的方法有很多，但它们的共同点是，为了有效，它们需要让读者想要继续阅读。前几行是让读者（这主要是指代理商、编辑和出版商）对您的故事感兴趣并继续阅读的名片。

## **Put a character in a setting 将角色放入设定中**

No, we don’t mean ‘it was a dark and stormy night’, the flowery opening to Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s Paul Clifford that is now regarded as a benchmark of bad writing. But you could introduce a place and create an atmosphere. ‘Grandma was laying out the cups for the funeral tea when I remembered I’d left the safe open’. ‘Mingus always slept on the red blanket in the back room’. ‘Laurence realised he’d left his phone in the office’ and ‘He couldn’t see the road for mist’ all locate someone in a place at the same time as introducing elements that invite people to read on. Whose funeral? What is in the safe? Why does Mingus sleep on that particular blanket? What are the implications of Laurence going back to the office? Whose journey is being stalled by mist, and where are they? Straight away, we have characters, locations, and questions begging to be answered.
不，我们的意思并不是“那是一个漆黑的暴风雨之夜”，爱德华·布尔沃-利顿的保罗·克利福德的华丽开场现在被视为糟糕写作的基准。但你可以介绍一个地方并营造一种氛围。 “当我想起我把保险箱打开时，奶奶正在摆放葬礼茶的杯子”。 “明格斯总是睡在后面房间的红色毯子上”。 “劳伦斯意识到他把手机落在办公室了”和“他因为雾气看不清路”都在介绍某人在某个地方的位置，同时引入了邀请人们继续阅读的元素。谁的葬礼？保险箱里有什么？为什么明格斯睡在那个特别的毯子上？劳伦斯回到办公室意味着什么？谁的旅程被雾气阻碍了？他们在哪里？我们立刻就有了角色、地点和需要回答的问题。

 

**WAYS TO FRAME AN OPENING 构建开头的方法****Flashforward/flashback 快闪/闪回** Begin with a significant scene that takes your reader forwards or backwards in the timescale of the story 从一个重要的场景开始，带领读者在故事的时间尺度上向前或向后**Dialogue 对话** Hook your reader with a significant line of dialogue. 用重要的对话来吸引读者。**Shock 震惊** Grab the reader’s attention with something dramatic and arresting. 用一些戏剧性和引人注目的东西来吸引读者的注意力。**Seduction 诱惑** The softly-softly approach – draw the reader into your story by snaring them with a suggestion of what’s to come. 轻柔的方法——通过暗示即将发生的事情来吸引读者进入你的故事。**In media res 在媒体资源中** Plunge straight into your story by starting in the middle of things, with a crucial situation linked to the rest of the narrative. 从事情的中间开始，直接进入你的故事，将一个关键的情况与叙述的其余部分联系起来。

## **Introduce a main character 介绍一个主角**

If you’re writing a character-driven novel or short story, begin with the character. Let the reader see something about that character that will make them want to get to know them better. Think of it as being introduced to a real person. ‘This is Emma and she works in HR’ is dull. What are you going to talk to Emma about? Client confidentiality? ‘This is Emma and she collects taxidermy frogs’ is a conversation starter.
如果您正在写一部以角色为主导的小说或短篇故事，请从角色开始。让读者看到有关该角色的一些东西，这会让他们想要更好地了解他们。将其视为被介绍给一个真实的人。 “这是艾玛，她在人力资源部工作”很无聊。你要和艾玛谈什么？客户保密？ “这是艾玛，她收集青蛙标本”是对话的开场白。

Don’t try to shoehorn in a full description right at the beginning: ‘Emma had yellow hair and blue eyes and was madly in love with her boyfriend Greg’ is a terrible start because the reader doesn’t know who Emma is or care about what she looks like or what she feels about her boyfriend. (You have to make them care). ‘Emma had blue hair and yellow eyes and had just eaten her boyfriend Greg’ is much more intriguing because it reverses conventional expectations. But better yet, make it something that relates to the rest of the novel or story. ‘Emma watched the cars crash in the distance,’ is the kind of line that suggests something about her (she’s the kind of person who watches cars crash/she’s a person who has just witnessed something dreadful). It also hints at what might be explained in the novel (why the cars crashed and why Emma watched them) and gives a clue to the writer’s style and what kind of narrative might follow (detached, dystopian).
不要试图在一开始就强加完整的描述：“艾玛有黄头发和蓝眼睛，并且疯狂地爱着她的男朋友格雷格”是一个糟糕的开始，因为读者不知道艾玛是谁或关心艾玛。她的长相或她对男友的感觉如何。 （你必须让他们关心）。 “艾玛有蓝色头发和黄色眼睛，刚刚吃了她的男朋友格雷格”更有趣，因为它扭转了传统的期望。但更好的是，让它与小说或故事的其余部分相关。 “艾玛看着远处的汽车相撞”这句话暗示了她的一些事情（她是那种看着汽车相撞的人/她是一个刚刚目睹了可怕的事情的人）。它还暗示了小说中可能解释的内容（为什么汽车相撞以及为什么艾玛看着它们），并为作者的风格以及接下来可能发生的叙述（超然的、反乌托邦的）提供了线索。

If the narrator is first-person, show something intriguing through their eyes and let their voice speak. ‘I’m watching the cars crash again. I got here just in time.’
如果叙述者是第一人称，请通过他们的眼睛展示一些有趣的东西，并让他们的声音说话。 “我又看到汽车相撞了。我来得正是时候。

 

## **Start with action 从行动开始**

Starting with action in a dramatic first scene is a good way to create impact and can be a really effective opener. Begin in media res, literally in the middle of things: at dramatic point in your story. It might be the discovery of a body if it’s a crime novel; the breakup with an unsatisfactory lover in a romcom. Put your reader in the middle of a scene rather than build up to it over pages and pages. Keep it active. ‘Emma woke up, got out of bed, cleaned her teeth and put the kettle on’ is humdrum. ‘Emma jumped out of the helicopter’ is dynamic. Use active verbs. But be careful here – if you want to start writing a novel with a dramatic scene you have to leave yourself somewhere to go throughout the rest of the story, so build up your story and hold your big guns in reserve for when you really need them later in the story, to create a dramatic showdown.
从戏剧性的第一个场景中的动作开始是产生影响的好方法，并且可以成为真正有效的开场白。从媒体资源开始，实际上是从事情的中间开始：在故事的戏剧性时刻。如果是犯罪小说，可能会是尸体的发现；浪漫喜剧中与不满意的情人分手。让读者置身于场景之中，而不是一页一页地阅读。保持活跃。 “艾玛醒了，起床，刷牙，打开水壶”，这很乏味。 “艾玛从直升机上跳下来”是动态的。使用主动动词。但这里要小心——如果你想开始写一部有戏剧性场景的小说，你必须给自己留出一个地方来完成故事的其余部分，所以建立你的故事，并保留你的大枪，以备你真正需要时使用在故事的后期，打造了一场戏剧性的对决。

 

## **Hook them in 把他们钩进去**

How you do this will have a lot to do with what kind of story you’re writing. If it’s literary, it’ll be by creating a unique voice and a tantalising proposition that will make readers think ‘I haven’t read anything like this before.’ If it’s crime, your first task may well be to home in on the inciting incident – ie, the crime that sparks the investigation. ‘The stab wounds precisely corresponded to the positions of the stars in the constellation of The Plough,’ might make you want to read on and discover about a serial killer with a penchant for astronomy. If it’s horror, you’ll be wanting to create a suggestion that all is not well: ‘It always felt damp in that room’. If it’s historical, you’ll need to introduce setting and period as well as character: ‘Abigail wished she had the freedoms permitted to her brother, and was allowed to ride up front on the coachman’s seat’. It’s amazing what you can do in a sentence when you really think about it.
你如何做到这一点与你要写什么样的故事有很大关系。如果是文学性的，那就是通过创造独特的声音和诱人的命题，让读者认为“我以前从未读过这样的东西。”如果是犯罪性的，你的首要任务很可能就是抓住煽动性的内容事件——即引发调查的犯罪行为。 “刺伤与犁星座中星星的位置精确对应”，可能会让你想继续阅读并发现一个对天文学有兴趣的连环杀手。如果是恐怖，你会想要提出一个一切都不太好的暗示：“那个房间总是感觉潮湿”。如果是历史性的，你需要介绍背景、时期和人物：“阿比盖尔希望她能拥有她哥哥所允许的自由，并被允许坐在车夫的座位上”。当你认真思考时，你能用一句话来表达出惊人的东西。

 

## **Make it clear 讲清楚**

Although you want to intrigue your reader, you also want to invite them to read on, which means putting them at their ease so they can comfortably carry on reading. If you can evoke the atmosphere of your novel in the first few lines, or suggest something about its storyline, or introduce a main character, you’ll be giving readers a taste of what they can reasonably expect the rest of the book to be like. Readers will be looking for clues about what to expect right from the beginning so anything you mention at the start will assume a particular significance.
虽然你想引起读者的兴趣，但你也想邀请他们继续阅读，这意味着让他们放松，这样他们就可以舒适地继续阅读。如果你能在前几行中唤起小说的氛围，或者对故事情节提出一些建议，或者介绍一个主角，那么你就会让读者体验到他们可以合理地期望本书的其余部分是什么样子。读者将从一开始就寻找有关预期内容的线索，因此您在开头提到的任何内容都将具有特殊的意义。

As readers are actively hoping to be invited in by the start of your work, you want them to be intrigued enough to carry on reading but not bewildered – even if you’re conjuring a dark wood full of murderers you need to make your reader feel ‘safe’ – in the sense of understanding that you have created a fictional world that they can rely on to deliver a satisfying reading experience.
当读者积极希望在你的作品开始时被邀请进来时，你希望他们有足够的兴趣继续阅读，但不要感到困惑——即使你正在召唤一个充满凶手的黑暗森林，你也需要让你的读者感觉到“安全”——理解你创造了一个虚构的世界，他们可以依靠这个世界来提供令人满意的阅读体验。

 

## **Have a distinctive voice 拥有独特的声音**

One of the most important elements at the start of a story is the voice in which it’s told. Your opening is the first and most important opportunity for the reader to encounter your narrative style, or voice. So give them a taste of it. Think of the beginnings of stories you love, and how each one could only have been written by that particular writer, whether it’s Stephen King, Charles Dickens, Zadie Smith or Virginia Woolf. Be like them, as in write those vital first lines in a voice that’s unique to you. But don’t try and copy them – find your own writing voice and showcase it to best effect right at the beginning of your story.
故事开头最重要的元素之一是讲述故事的声音。你的开头是读者接触你的叙述风格或声音的第一个也是最重要的机会。所以让他们尝尝吧。想想你喜欢的故事的开头，以及为什么每个故事只能由特定的作家写成，无论是斯蒂芬·金、查尔斯·狄更斯、扎迪·史密斯还是弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫。像他们一样，用你独特的声音写下重要的第一行。但不要试图复制它们——找到你自己的写作声音，并在故事的开头展示它以达到最佳效果。

If your story has a first-person narrator, you need to establish their voice right at the beginning, so make sure their first words create an impression, and evoke a sense of the person saying them.
如果您的故事有第一人称叙述者，您需要从一开始就确定他们的声音，因此请确保他们的第一句话给人留下深刻的印象，并唤起说这些话的人的感觉。

 

## **Make it dynamic 使其充满活力**

Drop readers straight into a scene; give them the impression that they have caught something really interesting as it’s unfolding. Rather than build up to a climax, put the reader right in the middle of an event. Think cinematically. The opening scene of *The Handmaid’s Tale* on TV showed a family being chased through the woods. At that point viewers didn’t know who the family were or the significance of the chase, but it made for a gripping start to the series. You can replicate narrative style to dramatic effect in your writing by plunging the reader into the middle of a scene. No set-up, just action and impact. Later, you will need to make sense of it but this is a striking way to begin a story if you have an opening scene that justifies such impact (ie, it might be a great way to launch a thriller, with a fight or chase, but less useful for a rural romcom, where the village knitting marathon will not lead to the same element of tension).
让读者直接进入场景；给他们这样的印象：他们发现了一些非常有趣的事情正在展开。不要让读者达到高潮，而要把读者置于事件的中心。用电影的方式思考。电视上《使女的故事》的开场场景是一家人在树林里被追赶。当时观众不知道这家人是谁，也不知道这场追逐的意义，但这为该剧带来了扣人心弦的开端。通过将读者带入场景的中间，您可以在写作中复制叙事风格以达到戏剧效果。没有设置，只有行动和影响。稍后，你需要理解它，但如果你有一个开场场景证明这种影响是合理的，那么这是开始故事的一种引人注目的方式（即，这可能是启动惊悚片的好方法，有打斗或追逐，但对于乡村浪漫喜剧来说不太有用，乡村编织马拉松不会导致同样的紧张气氛）。

 

## **An arresting line of dialogue 引人注目的对话**

Just as you can be stopped in your tracks by hearing someone say something – in real life, in a play, in a film – you can grab a reader’s attention from the start with a great line of dialogue. Just make sure it’s either really great or at the very least has dramatic impact. And remember to add context as soon as possible after the dialogue, to start to fill in the picture to give the reader a sense of the context in which the words are spoken. This does not mean starting with ‘I want a divorce’ and adding a mundane line like ‘said Emma as she filled the kettle while her husband Ian ate his toast.’ You’d need to show how the sight of Ian munching his way through yet another slice of wholemeal fills Emma with existential despair.
就像在现实生活中、戏剧中、电影中听到某人说话时你可能会停下来一样，你可以从一开始就用精彩的对话抓住读者的注意力。只要确保它真的很棒或者至少具有巨大的影响即可。并记住在对话后尽快添加上下文，开始填写图片，让读者了解说话的上下文。这并不意味着以“我想要离婚”开始，然后添加一句平凡的台词，比如“艾玛在她丈夫伊恩吃吐司的时候给水壶注水时说道。”你需要展示伊恩咀嚼着他的吐司的景象。另一片全麦麦片让艾玛充满了存在主义的绝望。

The start of your story is so important it’s worth experimenting several different introductions to see what works best. It may be that you know exactly where your story begins, or it may be that you’re looking for the best way in. As with everything with creative writing, there’s no one-size-fits-all method, and you need to apply the best one for your particular story. Test it several ways. Be prepared to revise it when you’ve finished and refine it until it’s perfect. We hope these story-starting tips will help you. Good luck!
故事的开头非常重要，值得尝试几种不同的介绍，看看哪种最有效。可能你确切地知道你的故事从哪里开始，或者你可能正在寻找最好的进入方式。与创意写作的一切一样，没有一刀切的方法，你需要应用最适合您的特定故事的一个。通过多种方式进行测试。完成后准备好修改并完善它直到完美。我们希望这些故事开头的技巧能够对您有所帮助。祝你好运！
