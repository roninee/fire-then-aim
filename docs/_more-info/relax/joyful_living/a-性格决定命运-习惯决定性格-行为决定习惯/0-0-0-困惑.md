# Should we be responsible for the happiness of other people?我们应该为他人的幸福负责吗？

---

*No.*

*I learned that other people are not responsible for making one happy.*
我了解到其他人没有责任让自己快乐。

That said, heaven forfend that other people think my mission upon this planet is to make them happy.
话虽如此，但愿其他人认为我在这个星球上的使命是让他们快乐。

It actually pisses me off when people depend on others to make them “happy”. Guess what? You are responsible for your own happiness.
*当人们依赖别人让他们“快乐”时，这实际上让我很生气。你猜怎么了？你要为自己的幸福负责。*

Happiness is a real choice a person can make when they wake up. I have a lot of issues I could have a pity party each day for myself.
*幸福是一个人醒来时可以做出的真正选择。我有很多问题，我每天都可以为自己举办一场可怜派对。*

Instead I choose to be happy despite having lethal food allergies, PTSD, ADHD, anxiety, and depression.
相反，尽管我患有致命的食物过敏、创伤后应激障碍、多动症、焦虑和抑郁，但我还是选择快乐。

I look for the silver lining in everything even if it is laughable.
我在每件事中寻找一线希望，即使它很可笑。

The only thing worse than not choosing to be happy and make the best of your day is trying to ruin someone else’s day too. That's just plain mean spirited.
*唯一比不选择快乐并充分利用自己的一天更糟糕的是试图破坏别人的一天。这简直就是心狠手辣。*

*I wanted to make this a short answer and say; “No you are not responsible for another person’s happiness*. As long as you are not forcing another person to do anything, *you should assume that everyone is in control of this life and the next, and not the lives of others.”*
我想对此做一个简短的回答并说： “不，你不需要为另一个人的幸福负责。只要你不强迫别人做任何事情，你就应该假设每个人都可以控制今生和来世，而不是别人的生活。”

But upon deeper reflection, I concluded that this was a way to compartmentalize happiness, and make it a linear string of events that only happen to one person. It is only one half the story.
但经过更深入的反思，我得出的结论是，这是一种划分幸福的方式，并使其成为一系列只发生在一个人身上的线性事件。这只是故事的一半。

The way life is lived, it is not a string of events but a mass, a weave of events that stretches infinitely. The tug at one pulls a slew of others with it and disrupts the weave.
*生活的方式不是一连串的事件，而是一团、无限延伸的事件的交织。对其中一个的拉扯会拉动许多其他的，并破坏编织。*

Instead, you are responsible for your own happiness, because your wellbeing helps other’s cultivate their own happiness. Our duty as a species is to alleviate the suffering of others, and to be a universal friend and guide to others to their own happiness. It is the responsible thing to do to offer empathy, kindness, and wisdom in situations where it is warranted to enable others to discover their ...
*相反，你要对自己的幸福负责，因为你的幸福可以帮助别人培养他们自己的幸福。作为一个物种，我们的责任是减轻他人的痛苦，成为普遍的朋友并引导他人走向幸福。在有必要让他人发现他们的……的情况下，提供同理心、善良和智慧是负责任的事情。*

# Why do I feel responsible for other people's happiness?

为什么我觉得对其他人的幸福负有责任？

---

You obviously have natural leadership abilities. However, the possible foible of having that ability is *feeling responsible for others and their happiness*. Believe it or not, that issue has *nothing to do* with your leadership abilities. It has to do with an unresolved conviction within you that is playing out through your leadership abilities.
**您显然具有天生的领导能力。然而，拥有这种能力的一个可能的缺点是感觉对他人及其幸福负责**。不管你相信与否，这个问题与你的领导能力无关。**这与你内心尚未解决的信念有关**，而这种信念正在通过你的领导能力发挥作用。

Leadership abilities aside, we might benefit greatly here by focusing on what you aren’t allowing yourself to feel and come to terms with, yet are regularly projecting through your experiences with others.
抛开领导能力不谈，**通过关注你不允许自己感受和接受的事情，我们可能会从中受益匪浅**，但你会定期通过你与他人的经历进行投射。

What I am talking about is your deep feeling of *desperation to effect the lives of others, even to the point in which you are losing your own inner balance.* This desperation can arise from many different emotional paradigms.
我所说的是你对影响他人生活的深深的绝望感，甚至到了你内心失去平衡的程度。这种绝望可能源于许多不同的情感范式。

1. You are seeking the *approval and acceptance* of others to the point where you cannot say no to them.
   你正在寻求他人的认可和接受，以至于你无法拒绝他们。
2. You have a *‘hero’ complex.* You need to be looked up to in order to feel like a worthwhile and worthy human being.
   你有一种“英雄”情结。你需要受到尊重，才能感觉自己是一个有价值的、有价值的人。
3. You have a *conviction of inadequacy in others* that you feel only you can fix.
   你坚信别人的不足，而你觉得只有你才能弥补。
4. You have a belief that in *self sacrifice* you are somehow more acknowledged and accepted by a higher power.
   你相信，通过自我牺牲，你会在某种程度上得到更高权力的认可和接受。
5. You believe that since you have leadership skills, you are supposed to ‘spread the wealth’ and *make everyone’s happiness your business and responsibility.*
   你相信，既然你有领导能力，你就应该“传播财富”，让每个人的幸福成为你的事业和责任。
6. *Your happiness* depends upon seeing those around you happy.
   你的幸福取决于看到你周围的人幸福。
7. You feel some form of *‘guilt’* concerning your fellow man. This is most rare and is a carryover from another lifetime. I do not know your beliefs, but I am adding this anyway.
   你对你的同胞感到某种形式的“内疚”。这是最罕见的，是另一世的遗留物。我不知道你的信仰，但我还是添加了这一点。

Every single one of these issues has a payoff. You are giving to GET something for yourself. Now we all know that this world is full of people with leadership abilities who are not saints or even perfectly in balance emotionally. However, among them are many who do not use their skills in ways that bring imbalance to them and their own lives. *What we do is meant to feed into our own life balance, not deplete it.*
这些问题中的每一个问题都会带来回报。你付出是为了为自己得到一些东西。现在我们都知道，这个世界上充满了具有领导能力的人，他们不是圣人，甚至在情感上也不是完美平衡的。然而，其中有许多人没有以给自己和自己的生活带来不平衡的方式使用自己的技能。我们所做的一切都是为了维持我们自己的生活平衡，而不是耗尽它。

Then, from that balance, we act, we lead, we respond to life and partner life.
然后，在这种平衡的基础上，我们行动、领导、回应生活和伴侣的生活。

When we pollute our skills with emotional issues, you create weakness in your own balance, and limitations in what you can give, and how you can use your skills.
当我们因情绪问题而污染了我们的技能时，你就会在自己的平衡方面产生弱点，并在你可以给予什么以及如何使用你的技能方面受到限制。

Since we do not know what the issue actually is with you, I would ask you to reflect upon the reasons I have given here and try to feel in your heart which one or ones give you more of a feeling response.
由于我们不知道您的实际问题是什么，所以我请您反思一下我在这里给出的原因，并尝试在您的心中感受哪一个或几个给您更多的感觉反应。由于我们不知道你到底有什么问题，我想请你反思我在这里给出的理由，并试着在你的心里感受哪一个或哪一个给你更多的感觉反应。

Truly great leaders are the ones who can see the greatness in others. From that place, they express from their own balance. They do so not for a payoff or to get something that only they can give to themselves, but out of knowing of their unity with mankind. Of course if you support yourself in a leadership capacity there must be a payoff. However, the issues I mentioned could still apply. One can give with quality and integrity.
真正伟大的领导者是那些能够看到别人的伟大之处的人。从那个地方，他们用自己的平衡来表达。他们这样做不是为了得到回报，也不是为了得到只有他们自己才能给予的东西，而是出于对他们与人类团结的了解。当然，如果你以领导能力支持自己，就一定会有回报。然而，我提到的问题仍然适用。一个人可以以优质和诚信的方式给予。

You are already a wholly worthwhile and important human being. Your ‘goodness’ and self worth doesn’t depend upon a single thing you do. Who you ARE is a being of quality. You were created by divine genius and empowered to create, to love, to grow and to know joy. You are a valuable aspect of this divine creation, and are meant to be you, unique as only you can be. And here, in this Earth school, we fall into the mud time and time again, but in doing so arise with new knowledge and courage. Mistakes are the heart of our curriculum here. They reveal.
你已经是一个完全有价值且重要的人了。你的“善良”和自我价值并不取决于你所做的任何一件事。你是谁是一个有品质的人。你是由神圣的天才创造的，并被赋予创造、爱、成长和了解快乐的能力。你是这个神圣创造物的一个有价值的方面，并且注定是你，只有你才能成为独一无二的。在这里，在这个地球学校，我们一次又一次陷入泥沼，但在这样做的过程中，我们会获得新的知识和勇气。错误是我们这里课程的核心。他们揭示了。

What we experience, we do so to learn how to free ourselves from our forgetfulness of our magnificent truth. When we harm, we are harmed via the law of Karma, not to be punished, but to learn how it feels. In this way our awareness grows to flow in harmony with universal love.
我们所经历的一切，都是为了学习如何使自己摆脱对伟大真理的遗忘。当我们伤害时，我们是通过业力法则受到伤害，不是为了受到惩罚，而是为了了解它的感受。这样，我们的意识就会与博爱和谐地流动。

To give to others without seeking a payoff, from a place of your own sense of fullness and self confirmation is the truest form of giving.
*不求回报地给予他人，从自己的充实感和自我确认出发，才是最真实的给予。*

Your happiness should not depend upon the happiness of others. Being miserable with another human being is not virtuous, nor is it proof of love.
你的幸福不应该取决于别人的幸福。对另一个人感到痛苦并不是美德，也不是爱的证明。

Happiness is a response to life, not a commodity determined by substance. It is part of the electricity of our life force. We hold it back by using the power of our own minds to believe it can only happen under certain circumstances. That is not the truth……nowhere near it.
幸福是对生活的一种反应，而不是由物质决定的商品。它是我们生命力电力的一部分。我们用自己的思想力量来阻止它，相信它只会在某些情况下发生。这不是事实……远非事实。

The only happiness anyone can feel from your actions, is their own happiness that they have allowed to flow as a response to you. YOU don’t give happiness. You can only invoke already present happiness in others. You did not create others. The power and intelligence that DID, created happiness within their life force. Its already been given to them. All YOU can ever do, is trigger it to emerge. To be a trigger, you do not have to wreak havoc in your own life. You do not have to don your sack cloth and ashes to become some martyr. That is wholly unnecessary and ultimately an exercise in futility.
任何人都能从你的行为中感受到的唯一幸福，就是他们自己的幸福，他们允许这种幸福作为对你的回应。*你不给予幸福。你只能唤起别人已经存在的幸福。你没有创造其他人。力量和智慧在他们的生命力中创造了幸福。*它已经给了他们。你所能做的就是触发它出现。要成为触发者，你不必对自己的生活造成严重破坏。你不必穿上麻布和骨灰才能成为烈士。这是完全没有必要的，而且最终也是徒劳的。

All human beings are here fully empowered to live their lives, just as you are. All human beings are your equals. They are merely playing different roles in this lifetime “purposely” and sanctioned by their Souls so they can heal aspects of themselves that they long to heal. They do not merit pity, nor convictions of their weakness. Our experiences and roles do not define us. Nor do they remain. They are all temporary. All beings are strong, fearless and they agreed to play these roles before they were born in order to move forward into newfound freedom. No one is sanctioned to “fix” another person’s life. This does not mean we should not have compassion. All beings merit compassion for the difficulty of a life in this world.
*所有人类都在这里完全有能力过自己的生活*，就像你一样。所有人类都是平等的。他们只是在这一生中“有目的地”扮演不同的角色，并受到灵魂的认可，这样他们就可以治愈自己渴望治愈的方面。*他们不值得怜悯，也不值得相信自己的软弱。我们的经历和角色并不能定义我们。他们也没有留下来。它们都是暂时的*。所有的生物都是坚强、无所畏惧的，他们在出生前就同意扮演这些角色，以便迈向新的自由。*没有人有权“修复”另一个人的生活。这并不意味着我们不应该有同情心*。一切众生都应该对这个世界上生活的困难有慈悲心。

So know your full belonging in the creation. Know that all are your equals, despite their ‘lot’ in life. Know that you are already worthy of all joy, love and fulfillment. No pitying your fellowman. Each person is the self authority of their own life. It isn’t you. It isn’t anyone else. It is within the heart that beats in each chest, their divine source has already given them everything. Just remind. Don’t fix.
所以要知道你对创造的完全归属。要知道，尽管*生活中的“命运”不同，但所有人都是平等的*。知道你已经值得所有的快乐、爱和满足。*不用怜悯你的同胞。每个人都是自己生活的自我权威。不是你。不是别人*。正是在每个胸腔中跳动的心脏中，他们的神圣源泉已经赋予了他们一切。只是提醒一下。不要修复。

It is wonderful to yearn to help others feel happy in their lives as long as it isn’t for an agenda based upon your own emotional issues. Then it is merely enabling to you.
渴望帮助别人在生活中感到快乐是一件很棒的事情，只要这不是基于你自己的情感问题的议程。那么它只是为你提供帮助。

Just don’t overstep your boundaries. Keep your own heart and mind in balance. That is the secret of truly giving the highest quality of yourself. Give to others your acknowledgement of their strength. This is a priceless gift that truly keeps on giving!
*只是不要超越你的界限。保持自己的内心和思想平衡。这就是真正展现出自己最高品质的秘诀。承认他人的力量。这是一份真正不断奉献的无价礼物！*

I hope this helps. I wish you the very best.
我希望这有帮助。我祝你一切顺利。

Since you have asked me Arpita, I will extend to you the same advice that I gave my daughter about 15 years ago. She was about 25 years old then living with us at home. One day I came up to her bedroom only to find her crying bitterly. I knew she was having some issues with her then boyfriend, so obviously presumed it was that problem that was getting her down.
既然你问了我 Arpita，我将向你提供大约 15 年前我给我女儿的同样的建议。她大约25岁，当时和我们一起住在家里。有一天，我来到她的卧室，却发现**她正在痛哭**。我知道她和当时的男朋友有一些问题，所以显然我认为正是这个问题让她情绪低落。

But it was not. She told me, similar to your subtext, that she found herself in a position of trying to placate all her friends and help them overcome their worries and concerns, and recently it had got so much that she was actually feeling drained. Like yourself, she had taken on the mantle of acting as their motivator and in some ways their therapist.
但事实并非如此。她告诉我，与你的潜台词类似，**她发现自己处于试图安抚所有朋友并帮助他们克服忧虑和担忧的境地，而最近事情太多了，她实际上感到筋疲力尽。**和你一样，她承担了充当他们的激励者的职责，在某些方面也是他们的治疗师。

I tried to be understanding and told her what I would like to impart to you now. It is easy if you are a kind, considerate and caring person to get into a habit of helping others, and this is no bad thing. The trouble is that some people take things for granted and once you start on this road of trying to spread happiness and motivation to all your friends, you will kind of become set in everybody’s expectations in that role which is not so good for you.
我尽力表示理解并告诉她我现在想向您传达的信息。**如果你是一个善良、体贴、有爱心的人，很容易养成帮助别人的习惯，这并不是坏事。问题在于，有些人认为事情是理所当然的，一旦你开始尝试向所有朋友传播快乐和动力，你就会陷入每个人对你的期望中，而这对你来说不太好。**

As you say yourself, everyone will be moving on with your advice, whilst you will be on the back burner, worn out with the adopted role you have now borne as being everyone’s saviour.
正如你自己所说，**每个人都会继续采纳你的建议，而你会被放在次要位置**，对你现在扮演的每个人的救世主的角色感到厌倦。

Where my daughter was concerned, it started because she really did not want to face up to her own dramas; it was in fact easier to put that behind her and help others with their issues. May be there is a little bit of this that is apparent in your current situation?
就我女儿而言，一开始是因为她真的不想面对自己的戏剧；事实上，把这件事抛在脑后并帮助其他人解决问题更容易。在你目前的情况下，是否有一些明显的现象？

The thing to do is to reassess your situation. Work out how you can help your friends in moderation, but finding time and space needed to manage your own life. You need to establish new guidelines, set up boundaries in order that you protect yourself from the feelings of maintaining too much responsibility to others. You will find a new way of managing the situation in this manner.
要做的就是重新评估你的情况。弄清楚如何**适度**地帮助你的朋友，但要找到管理自己生活所需的时间和空间。你需要制定新的指导方针，**设定界限**，以**保护自己免受对他人承担过多责任的感觉**。您将找到一种以这种方式管理情况的新方法。

As far as my daughter was concerned, for once she listened to me (does not always happen). She sorted her own difficulties out. Explained things in a very straight forward and honest manner to her friends. They all understood and backed off a little. She did not lose one friend as far as I remember, and if she did it would not have been a big deal because they would not have been a good friend if they did not understand her difficulties.
就我女儿而言，这是她第一次听了我的话（并不总是如此）。她解决了自己的困难。以非常直接和诚实的方式向她的朋友解释事情。他们都明白了，都退了一些。**据我所知，她没有失去一个朋友，即使她失去了，也没什么大不了的，因为如果他们不理解她的困难，他们就不会成为好朋友。**

Someone abused you. Someone made you have to hone in on their feelings early in life, to stay safe..and you were trained to know if you do not make them feel better..you will somehow suffer..or be blamed or feel more pain. You also are often blamed for their negative feelings…and eventually, you start to believe you must have done something…to cause it…you must be to blame. (this is not rational..but it still runs us unconsciously).
有人虐待你。有人让你必须在生命的早期磨练他们的感受，以保持安全..你被训练知道如果你不让他们感觉更好..你会以某种方式受苦..或被指责或感到更多痛苦。你也经常因为他们的负面情绪而受到指责……最终，你开始相信你一定做了什么……导致了这种情况……你必须受到责备。 （这不是理性的……但它仍然在不知不觉中驱使着我们）。

Understanding and considering and responding in a healthy way to someone's emotions, without taking them on as your own pain or discomfort is healthy empathy.. but feeling other’s pain as your own and feeling compelled to make everything ok or you will not be.. is a subconscious belief that others feeling negative..affects and endangers you, your worth, your point of being welcome, or your emotions…or your life. Abusers will make sure you unconsciously (autopilot) know if they are not ok..neither are you!
*理解、考虑和以健康的方式回应某人的情绪，而不是将其视为自己的痛苦或不适，这是健康的同理心。但是，将他人的痛苦视为自己的痛苦，并感到有必要让一切都好起来，否则你就不会......是健康的同理心*。潜意识中认为其他人感到消极……会影响并危及您、您的价值、您的受欢迎程度、您的情绪……或您的生活。施虐者会确保您无意识地（自动驾驶仪）知道他们是否不好……您也一样！

This idea of needing to ‘fix’ others emotions has no boundaries..it does not pertain only to the abuser.. it ripples to everyone in your life experience.
*这种需要“修复”他人情绪的想法是没有界限的*……它不仅仅与施虐者有关……它会波及到你生活经历中的每个人。

I can not go into a crowded room… I suffer for it..unless everyone is celebrating and happy…then I am ok. If people are fussing and sad…looking bored or dissatisfied..angry..my strangled mind starts searching for something to change it. I will run in circles keeping everyone ok… but is it really for them?..no no.. It was for me.
我不能进入拥挤的房间……我为此受苦……除非每个人都在庆祝和快乐……那么我就没事了。如果人们大惊小怪、悲伤……看起来无聊或不满意……愤怒……我被窒息的心灵开始寻找一些东西来改变它。我会绕圈跑，让每个人都没事……但这真的是为了他们吗？……不，不……这是为了我。

We are responsible for ourselves…when we ignore our own feelings as nothing and not important.. and other’s feelings as vital to our peace and even our existence as being ok..we are blinded by broken beliefs..lies! Our subconscious mind tells us we have to, or we will suffer or be in danger. (These beliefs may have saved you when you were with the abuser (ie..Narc Mother)..but once you are not..you no longer need them..they no longer serve you.)
我们要对自己负责……当我们忽视自己的感受，认为自己什么都不是，不重要……而其他人的感受对我们的和平甚至我们的存在至关重要时，我们就被破碎的信仰蒙蔽了双眼……谎言！我们的潜意识告诉我们必须这样做，否则我们会受苦或处于危险之中。 （当您与施虐者（即缉毒警察母亲）在一起时，这些信念可能拯救了您……但是一旦您不再……您就不再需要它们……它们不再为您服务。）

To change our subconscious programming is a process, but the first step..and the hardest.. is noticing the disfunction in our autopilot’s programming and accept these programmings have caused our suffering…and that they are lies.
改变我们的潜意识编程是一个过程，但第一步……也是最困难的……是注意到我们的自动驾驶仪编程中的功能障碍，并接受这些编程给我们带来了痛苦……而且它们是谎言。

Once we see this, accept it without self-bashing or judging.. the rest is just choices of what to believe..what is actually truth… and repetition of that truth!
一旦我们看到这一点，就接受它，不要自责或评判……剩下的只是选择相信什么……什么是真正的真理……以及重复这个真理！

Truth and love.. and self-gifted freedom!
真理和爱......以及自我赋予的自由！
