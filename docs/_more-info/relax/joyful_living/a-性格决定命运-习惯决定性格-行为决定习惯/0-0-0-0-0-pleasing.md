The number one obstacle that gets in the way of us being our own hero is **prioritising who we think we should be over who we actually are.**
阻碍我们成为自己英雄的第一个障碍是先考虑我们认为自己~~*应该成为*~~什么样的人，而不是*我们实际是谁*--我们实际是谁更重要，而不是应该。

When we do this, we end up living according to other people’s values and beliefs rather than our own (also called “**people-pleasing**”). This is a bit like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole; it creates friction, discord and a whole ton of internal conflict. We’ve usually had excellent reasons to prioritise other people’s beliefs and values over our own in the past but doing this doesn’t serve us as adults.
当我们这样做时，我们最终会按照别人的价值观和信仰而不是我们自己的价值观和信仰生活（也称为“**取悦他人**”）。这有**点像试图将方钉装入圆孔。它会造成摩擦、不和和大量的内部冲突。过去，我们通常有充分的理由优先考虑别人的信仰和价值观，而不是我们自己的信仰和价值观，但这样做对我们作为成年人来说并不有利。**

### The different “types” of people-pleasing 取悦他人的不同“类型”

People-pleasing comes in a variety of flavours. This is why it can feel so intangible and hard to identify at times. Here are the five main types of people-pleasing that we might encounter, as explained by Dr Jay Earley in his [Self-Therapy Journey](https://selftherapyjourney.com/Pattern/Description/People_Pleasing_Pattern_Description_Marketing.aspx?utm_source=pgp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=people-pleasing-page). 
取悦人们的有多种口味。这就是为什么它有时会让人感觉如此无形且难以识别。正如杰伊·厄利博士在他的自我治疗之旅中所解释的，以下是我们可能会遇到的*五种主要取悦他人的类型*。

- **Conflict Avoidant:** When you go out of your way to avoid conflicts.
  避免冲突：当你竭尽全力避免冲突时。
- **Care-taking:** When you take care of and make sure the other person doesn’t feel uncomfortable.
  照顾：当你照顾并确保对方不会感到不舒服时。
- **Compliance:** When you go along with what other people think, feel, and want.
  顺从：当你同意别人的想法、感受和愿望时。
- **Active pleasing:** When you anticipate what makes other people happy and give it to them.
  主动取悦：当你预期什么能让别人快乐并给予他们快乐时。
- **Merging:** When you try to be the same as a partner or a special person, assuming their interests, lifestyle, and life path even when it doesn’t fit with your own.
  融合：当你试图与伴侣或特殊的人一样时，假设他们的兴趣、生活方式和人生道路，即使它们与你自己的不符。

### *What’s the alternative*? 还有什么选择呢？

**Conflict Accepting**: Acknowledging and accepting that conflicts are a part of life. The closer the relationship, the more likely it is that you’ll have conflicts from time to time. When two people with different histories, different needs and different preferences are in close relationship, it’s natural that those histories, needs, and preferences will bump up against each other at times. Annoyance, frustration, anger and hurt are healthy reactions to situations where we feel like we’ve been wronged, or to situations that run counter to our needs.
**接受冲突**：承认并接受冲突是生活的一部分。关系越亲密，就越有可能时不时地发生冲突。当两个有着不同历史、不同需求和不同偏好的人关系密切时，这些历史、需求和偏好有时会自然地发生冲突。烦恼、沮丧、愤怒和伤害是对我们感觉自己受到了委屈或与我们的需求背道而驰的情况的健康反应。

Part of being our own hero means acknowledging these feelings in ourselves while recognising that they don’t have to lead to an all-out fight. Note: conflict doesn’t necessarily mean fighting. If you currently associate conflict with fighting, think of it more like the stage between negotiation and argument.
成为我们自己的英雄意味着承认我们自己的这些感受，同时认识到它们不一定会导致全面的战斗。注意：冲突并不一定意味着战斗。如果您目前将冲突与战斗联系在一起，那么请将其视为谈判和争论之间的阶段。

**Care-taking**: It’s not your responsibility if someone else feels uncomfortable. If they do, it’s their job to figure out. Making assumptions for people isn’t fair on them, even if those assumptions are coming from a well-meaning place. Dropping the care-taking role means accepting that the other person (or people) is capable, resourceful, and has everything they need to create situations that work for them in life.
**照顾**：如果其他人感到不舒服，那不是你的责任。如果他们这样做了，他们的工作就是找出答案。为人们做出假设对他们来说是不公平的，即使这些假设是出于善意。放弃照顾角色意味着接受另一个人（或多个人）有能力、足智多谋，并且拥有创造对他们生活有利的环境所需的一切。

**Compliance**: We all know that everyone is different. Recognise that your own thoughts, feelings and desires are part of what makes you you and that individuating (i.e. learning to separate our needs and preferences from those of other people) is a natural part of becoming an adult.
**合规性**：我们都知道每个人都是不同的。认识到你自己的想法、感受和欲望是你的一部分，而个性化（即学会将我们的需求和偏好与其他人的需求和偏好分开）是成为成年人的自然部分。

Sometimes, other people might expect you to be compliant. Just as it’s not our job to make sure other people feel comfortable, it’s also not our job to conform to other people’s expectations. The right people will honour your individuality and accept this.
有时，其他人可能希望你顺从。正如确保其他人感到舒适不是我们的工作一样，满足其他人的期望也不是我们的工作。合适的人会尊重你的个性并接受这一点。

**Active pleasing**: On the surface, there’s nothing wrong with active pleasing. In fact, anticipating what makes other people happy and giving it to them is a beautiful addition to a relationship. The line between altruism and people-pleasing lies in whether we’re sacrificing our own needs to do so. Many of us are raised to believe that sacrifice is the ultimate virtue. In reality, it’s the ultimate path to frustration and burnout (N.B. In [Be Your Own Hero](https://gumroad.com/l/beyourownhero), we dive into the art of win-win negotiation, a skill that allows us to create situations that please other people and please ourselves).
**主动取悦**：从表面上看，主动取悦并没有什么问题。事实上，预测什么能让别人快乐并给予他们，是对一段关系的美好补充。*利他主义和取悦他人之间的界限在于我们是否为此牺牲了自己的需求*。我们中的许多人从小就相信牺牲是最终的美德。*事实上，这是通往挫折和倦怠的最终途径*（注：在《成为你自己的英雄》中，我们深入探讨了双赢谈判的艺术，这种技能使我们能够创造出既取悦他人又取悦自己的情境）。

**Merging**: When we’re used to merging with other people, it can be hard to know what not merging looks like. Therefore the first step is to recover our sense of our own needs and preferences, accept that these needs are just as important and valid as other people’s, and to recognise that no one else is going to come along and live our lives for us; that’s our responsibility and ours alone.
合并：当我们习惯于与其他人合并时，很难知道不合并是什么样子。因此，第一步是恢复我们对自己的需求和偏好的认识，接受这些需求与其他人的需求一样重要和有效，并认识到没有其他人会出现并为我们生活；这是我们的责任，也是我们自己的责任。
