# How to stop being so judgemental? 如何停止如此评判？

Hi All 大家好

So Ive been on my journey for awhile now and I have identified the biggest obstacle to my happiness - my judgemental and critical nature on everything and everyone, even myself.
所以我已经踏上这段旅程一段时间了，*我发现了我幸福的最大障碍——我对一切、每个人，甚至我自己的评判和批判本性。*

I am so conditioned to instantly have an opinion on everything, people, situations etc.. I find myself constantly judging everyone, from their appearance to their personality. It is exhausting and it just causes me to eventually judge myself.
*我习惯于立即*对一切、人、情况等发表意见。我发现自己不断地评判每个人，从他们的外表到他们的性格。这让人筋疲力尽，只会让我最终评判自己。

I would like to stop judging everything and just accept them for who they are
*我想停止评判一切并接受它们本来的样子*

How can i do this? I am already aware when I judge and will myself to stop. Will simply repeating this cause this behavior to cease eventually?
我怎样才能做到这一点？当我做出判断时，我已经意识到并希望自己停止。简单地重复这个就会导致这种行为最终停止吗？

*edit:I intellectually know that we are the same, that the judgment comes from my own insecurities, that there is no validity in the judgement..but i just cant seem to automatically stop making a judgment.
编辑：我在理智上知道我们是一样的，判断来自我自己的不安全感，判断没有有效性......但我似乎无法自动停止做出判断。*

Mental activity has greatly reduced unless needed, I am mindful almost all the time, the illusion of self is completely seen through, the world is seen from a non dual perspective now. Somatic and perceptual reactions still occur, but they arise and fall with no input from myself
除非需要，心理活动已经大大减少，*我几乎一直保持正念*，自我的幻象完全被看穿，现在从非二元的角度看待世界。躯体和知觉反应仍然会发生，但它们的产生和下降并不来自我自己的输入

The issue when I made the initial post was attempting to work on the self, as opposed to seeing through the illusory nature of it. Once properly realised, all these questions go away - there is no one to judge or be judged, so these reactions cease over time.
当我发表第一篇文章时，问题是试图在自我上努力，而不是看穿它的虚幻本质。一旦正确认识到这一点，所有这些问题都会消失——没有人可以评判或被评判，因此这些反应会随着时间的推移而消失。

> I judged because I cared too much. I wanted to be perfect so badly that I was overlooking my own flaws. For some reason that made me see them in others even more. Once I learned to accept myself for who I am without the need for anyone’s approval the judging just kind of stopped on its own.
> *我评判是因为我太在乎了。我太想变得完美，以至于忽略了自己的缺点。出于某种原因，这让我在其他人身上看到了更多的东西。一旦我学会接受自己，不需要任何人的认可，评判就自动停止了。*

> Things like this are funny. The solution is almost never to confront our problems directly or at least it seems that way. Almost like our problems are really just side effects of some other thing we’re doing that we aren’t really aware of.
> 这样的事情很有趣。*解决办法几乎永远不是直接面对我们的问题*，或者至少看起来是这样。几乎就像我们的问题实际上只是我们正在做的其他事情的副作用，而我们并没有真正意识到。

> First, you can’t just automatically stop any emotion. The best you can do is recognize them and let them go. Like some have already said here, recognized when you’re being judgemental towards someone and replace that thought with more compassion; remind yourself that you have no idea of what struggles or hardships that person is going through. It’s cliche but, “treat others how you want to be treated”.
> 首先，你不能自动停止任何情绪。你能做的最好的事情就是认出他们并让他们走。就像有些人已经在这里说过的那样，当你对某人做出评判时，要意识到这一点，并用更多的同情心取代这种想法；提醒自己，你不知道那个人正在经历什么挣扎或困难。这是陈词滥调，但“己所不欲，勿施于人”。

> For yourself, I think a lot of self judgment today is influenced by the use of social media. If you find that you spend most of your time scrolling through social media apps. Take a break. Personally, I go through phases of deleting the apps off my phone sometimes a few days sometimes a week. Recently I’ve set up the “down time” feature that locks all of the social media apps I have from 12pm-8pm. It’s a good reminder to be more present and productive. Another thing I’ve done is unfollowed stupid meme pages or fad pages on Instagram. Besides friends and family most of the pages I follow are things I find interesting. My page is now mostly filled Nature related posts (I’m an outdoorsy person). Basically, recognize things and thoughts that serve you no purpose and let them go. That said,maybe practice some mindful meditation. Meditation and yoga have been a huge help for me. Try the Calm app. It’s a great start.
> 就你自己而言，我认为今天的很多自我判断都受到社交媒体使用的影响。如果您发现自己大部分时间都在浏览社交媒体应用程序。休息一下。就我个人而言，我会经历从手机上删除应用程序的阶段，有时是几天，有时是每周。最近，我设置了“停机时间”功能，可以在中午 12 点至晚上 8 点锁定我所有的社交媒体应用程序。这是一个很好的提醒，让我们更加活在当下，更加富有成效。我做过的另一件事是取消关注 Instagram 上的愚蠢模因页面或时尚页面。除了朋友和家人之外，我关注的大部分页面都是我觉得有趣的东西。我的页面现在大部分都是与自然相关的帖子（我是一个喜欢户外活动的人）。基本上，认识到对你没有任何意义的事物和想法，然后放开它们。也就是说，也许练习一些正念冥想。冥想和瑜伽对我来说有很大的帮助。尝试“平静”应用程序。这是一个很好的开始。

> I’ve been practicing being more mindful in my own life for a bit over a year and I still have to remind myself of these things. It takes time but I’ve found I am more aware of my emotions and am better at letting things go along with being more calm and compassionate towards myself and others.
> 一年多以来，我一直在练习在自己的生活中更加正念，但我仍然必须提醒自己这些事情。这需要时间，但我发现我更能意识到自己的情绪，更善于顺其自然，对自己和他人更加冷静和富有同情心。

> Sorry this was super long !
> 抱歉这太长了！

> In addition to mindfulness practice, try getting involved with some kind of fast-paced improvisational creativity, e.g. dancing, music, improv comedy, story-based tabletop RPGs/LARPing, finger painting, or "automatic" writing. I used to have the same problem (still do on the worst days) and I've found that putting on some music and freestyle dancing alone for a few minutes can help to alleviate the tension, as the pace is too fast for my internal critic and it gets me out of my head and into my body.
> 除了正念练习之外，还可以尝试参与某种快节奏的即兴创作，例如舞蹈、音乐、即兴喜剧、基于故事的桌面角色扮演游戏/LARPing、手指画或“自动”写作。我曾经遇到过同样的问题（在最糟糕的日子里仍然如此），我发现单独放一些音乐和自由式舞蹈几分钟可以帮助缓解紧张感，因为节奏对我的内心批评者来说太快了它让我离开我的头脑，进入我的身体。

> Everyone has already given the advice of loving yourself first and understanding that it is a reflection of your self compassion. I'll give another piece to advice which is something you can start doing now and that I have found helpful when I am mindful enough to catch myself judging others. When I catch myself thinking thoughts about a stranger, I try to follow that up with multiple reflections on what are things about that person that make them awesome, likable, and special. Obviously these things are fantasy. But it helps build warm compassionate feelings for these strangers and I often think to myself afterwards, wow, I wish they were my friend.
> 每个人都已经给出了首先爱自己的建议，并理解这是自我同情心的反映。我将给出另一条建议，这是你现在就可以开始做的事情，当我足够注意地发现自己在评判他人时，我发现它很有帮助。当我发现自己在想一个陌生人时，我会尝试跟进这个人的哪些方面让他们很棒、讨人喜欢和特别。显然这些都是幻想。但这有助于为这些陌生人建立温暖的同情心，事后我经常对自己说，哇，我希望他们是我的朋友。

> For example, recently I thought a woman who looked kind of disheveled and I had a judgement. Afterwards I immediately thought, I bet she is really kind to her friends and her pets. I bet she talks to her parents on the phone and makes them happy. I bet she makes good puns. I find that building love and compassion for strangers like this makes me feel good.
> 例如，最近我想到一个看起来有点凌乱的女人，我就有了一个判断。后来我立刻想，我敢打赌她对她的朋友和她的宠物真的很好。我敢打赌她会通过电话与她的父母交谈并使他们高兴。我敢打赌她的双关语一定很好。我发现像这样对陌生人建立爱和同情心让我感觉很好。

> 1. You mentioned that you judge people on basis of their appearance. Tell yourself each time that you can never judge someone's potential or the beauty or ugliness of their thoughts by how they look. You just don't know. Just keep it at that. There's equal possibility of them being a wonderful person as of them being what you judged them to be. So to be kind, always extend the benefit of doubt to the other. And if you think this way, you will never judge anyone based on their appearance.
>    你提到你根据人们的外表来判断他们。每次告诉自己，你永远不能通过一个人的外表来判断他的潜力或他们思想的美丑。你只是不知道。就这样吧。他们成为一个优秀的人与成为你所评价的那样的人的可能性是相同的。因此，为了仁慈，总是把怀疑的好处延伸到对方身上。如果你这样想，你就永远不会根据外表来评判任何人。
> 2. Their actions. That's a bit more concrete than their appearance. But that doesn't mean you that you know 100% of their actions. You only saw a percent of their actions. Bring in the benefit of doubt again.
>    他们的行动。这比他们的外表更具体一些。但这并不意味着您 100% 了解他们的行为。你只看到了他们行为的百分之一。再次引入怀疑的好处。
> 3. To top this all, it's simply not our place to judge anyone or anything. Its a stranger and what they do or don't - bothers us in the least. Just know that and move on. Focus on your own actions and thoughts more.
>    最重要的是，这根本不是我们评判任何人或任何事的地方。这是一个陌生人，他们做什么或不做什么——一点也不打扰我们。只要知道这一点并继续前进即可。更多地关注自己的行动和想法。
> 4. If this person that you end up judging is always in your vicinity, for example, it's a room mate. Or maybe an acquaintance at work, just bring in the mixtures of point 1, 2 and 3 again. Not my place, I'd rather think for myself. You can never change the other, only yourself.
>    例如，如果你最终评判的这个人总是在你附近，那么他就是室友。或者也许是工作中的熟人，只需再次输入第 1、2 和 3 点的混合物即可。这不是我的立场，我宁愿自己思考。你永远无法改变别人，只能改变你自己。
> 5. Your over-critical nature. Are you fastidious? If yes, stop being one. There's a very fine line between being a perfectionist and being fastidious. When situations, unfavorable ones, are thrown at you, keep your calm. So if something was not done according to your taste and liking, it's okay. You should know this as a fact of life. Everything will never be how you want it. You just HAVE to deal with it. Might as well deal with it staying calm and collected. It's the easier way out if anything. Complaining only burdens your emotions more. Focus on THE work.
>    你过于挑剔的本性。你很挑剔吗？如果是，请停止成为其中之一。完美主义者和挑剔之间存在着非常微妙的界限。当遇到不利的情况时，请保持冷静。因此，如果某件事没有按照您的品味和喜好去做，也没关系。你应该知道这是生活中的事实。一切永远不会如你所愿。你只需要处理它。不妨保持冷静和镇定地处理它。如果有的话，这是更简单的出路。抱怨只会给你的情绪带来更多负担。专注于工作。
